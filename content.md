Tony-ism Magazine: Full Content
Foreword
(Page 4)
In loving memory of Gajender Batra, urf Tony, Bhai... Mamashree to me. Growing up, I was incredibly fortunate to have Tony Mama by my side. Sometimes he was a father figure, sometimes a friend, but most often he was my ever-cheerful, resourceful and loving "Mamashree". His presence was the highlight of my experiences at my Nani's house, and his ability to make everyone around him feel special left an indelible mark on my life. Through his actions and values, he imparted to me values that have subconsciously become a big part of who I am today.
This memory book is more than just a collection of remembrances; it's a celebration of his life and the joy he brought to all who knew him. This book is a collection of memories that reflect TONY-ism: the philosophy of living like TONY. It is a collection of memories that we have as a family. This book is a way to keep him and his legacy alive, particularly in the hearts of the people he touched, and also to share with the young ones who carry on ahead, and the little ones who have the right to experience his love. It is a collection- of laughter, love, tears and self-less devotion that made the man that he was.
Within these pages, you'll find a diverse array of elements: stories that capture the essence of his character, heartfelt messages of love, and poems from family and friends touched by his kindness and spirit. You'll also discover his passions - Bollywood, singing, cricket, puzzles woven throughout this interactive book, ensuring that his unique philosophy, which we lovingly call "TONY-ISM" lives on. Tony-ism reflects his approach to life, embodying principles of joy, generosity, and the ability to make every moment count.
This is just the beginning of a journey that started with a thought of how to keep him in our lives. Divya and I started with a vision, this is just the beginning of what we hope will be a continuing process of reliving Tony-ism, through which we aim to keep his legacy alive in our hearts and minds. Possibly future volumes, or days of celebrating Tony Mama, or different ways to cherish his kindness and zest for life. We will further explore his influence, offering new stories and insights from those who cherished him.
Hum Do Humare Char: Ek Pyaar Ka Nagma
(Page 8-10)
A trip down memory lane, with Poonam Batra, Tony's wife
Over time, our friendship grew into something more. एक प्यार का नगमा है, मौजों की खानी है, zindagi और कुछ भी नहीं, तेरी मेरी कहानी है। but like many love stories, my parents didn't approve A trip down memory lane, with Poonam Batra, Tony's wife The memories go back to the years we started meeting (I won't say dating). Those days, it was not considered good to date, and my parents disliked it, but we both couldn't stop meeting. For me, his friendly nature and open-heartedness were a magnet because I was not very attached to my family. He and his family seemed so close-knit, the difference between the two families was huge. His was a simple, religious family, and his humorous anecdotes about them and their warmth attracted me instantly. What he saw in me, I don't know. But we were always happy to see each other.
He used to come to Saket for work on his two- wheeler, and I was posted at the Nehru Place branch of BOB not very far. I knew he found excuses to come and see me, have a cup of tea in the bank or outside, and he would drop me home in Geetanjali on his scooter. We never thought of hiding from our parents, as we didn't think there was anything "special" between us - just two friends having a good time.
of the match for various reasons. We had to wait patiently for seven years. Ultimately, they gave in, but on their own terms, and never accepted our marriage till their end. But I was lucky. Tony's parents and relatives accepted me with open arms and never made me feel guilty.
We were blessed with two lovely children. Ashish and Divya, and I'm glad they have both imbibed their father's values of love and respect. He was a husband and father par excellence - a man of passion, always ready to fulfil your desires. Be it food, clothes, or gifts, you only had to mention it, and he'd get busy getting it. He religiously followed the principle that whenever you return home in the evening from work, never come empty-handed, bring something for your children or family.
We both loved to host parties and celebrate birthdays, not just of Ashish and Divya, but also Shweta and Abhishek. Our anniversary, parents' anniversary, and Bhaiya's anniversary too. The invitees included not only their school friends but also neighbors, friends, and extended family. The whole family would gather at our home for Rakhi and Tikka, and these occasions were celebrated with great enthusiasm, with ample gifts and food to suit everyone's tastes.
Each occasion was a testimony to his good nature. His generous supplies sometimes made us say, "Bas, aur nahi, nahi chahiye!" His friends and family loved this habit of gifting. But he went to such extremes that they seemed terrified! Whenever he visited, they were sure he'd bring so much to eat and gift so many things that they'd keep telling me to ask him not to bring so much.
He was always eager to fulfill your desires. He loved street food, loved to eat, but after being told to reduce weight, he had to avoid fried items. That made him a bit fussy. He'd bring snacks, want to eat them, but wouldn't, and that made everyone unhappy. "If you can't eat, why bring so much?" was a common reaction.
He bought clothes for himself regularly. but wouldn't wear them - always telling Bhaiya, "ए लो पापे, ए त्वानु आ जाएगा" He was super happy and excited when his clothes fit Nikesh, telling Divya that you have chosen the perfect boy and Nikesh was equally happy to wear his clothes and shoes.
He was an expert adviser on gifts - what to buy and from where. He knew every food joint - kahan ka khaana achha hai and had brilliant ideas for every function or wedding in the family or friends circle. And he wouldn't just give advice
he was willing and able to take responsibility and get it done himself. He had so many contacts and the confidence to ask - "भाई, मुझे ये काम था, हो पायेगा?" And nobody ever refused.
His friends were just like him - loving, friendly. generous. The best part? He was loved not only by his own peer group but also by their wives and children. All the bhabhis adored him, never tired of telling me how lucky I was to have such a good, loving husband. Their children respected him immensely, called him Tauji, and asked for advice freely. Even friends grandchildren - they all loved him, and he loved them. His absence is now felt in every function or gathering because I think they all sensed the inner vibes of pure love and affection that flowed through him.
Even the children near our house miss him terribly. He would carry small children in his arms and bring them home to give them chocolates. He would always ask Ashish to bring boxes of chocolates from his company to keep at home for just this purpose.
But all said and done. Tony and I lived a great life - full of ups and downs. I got angry more often than him, sometimes at his overly simplistic behavior and trusting nature. But he was the torchbearer and source of joy and happiness for everyone in the family - bringing a smile to every face, whether in the street, his friend circle, or any family gathering. No get-together was ever complete without him.
When I look at Divya, Ashish, and other children in the family, I see a reflection of Tony. They all have that "Tony-ism" in them - the way they made a group called Vaanar Sena, stood beside him till his last breath,
prayed for him, went to healers, consulted doctors, sourced rare medicines, and continue to offer 24x7 moral and physical support to me. A big salute to Tony-ism.
During our journey, we went through good times and bad, but we always received the love and support of Tony's family. I am thankful for their unconditional support. Thanks for being part of our journey and for the many pleasant experiences.
And what more can I say, except for the feeling left behind...
अकेले हैं, चले आओ जहाँ हो कहाँ आवाज़ दें तुमको, कहाँ हो अकेले हैं, चले आओ... ये तन्हाई का आलम और उस पर आपका गम न जीते हैं, न मरते बताओ, क्या करें हम अकेले हैं, चले आओ...
A Letter from a Son, to his Son (Ashish, Tony's Son)
(Page 11-13)
To my dearest Samarth, There's someone very special I want to tell you about with this letter, someone who would have loved you with all his heart. Someone you met very shortly, but whose love you carry in your presence, your smile, and your spirit. This letter is about your Dadu - my father a man I miss every single day. Your Dadu was the son every son wants to be. The way he took care of his parents was something I will always admire. He did everything under the sun to fulfill their needs, not just the big things, but also the smallest ones that only a truly loving son would notice. And it wasn't just his parents, he extended that same respect and service to every elder in the family. His uncles, aunts, even his elder siblings, he looked after them all with deep affection and a sense of duty that came naturally to him. Your Dadu was the brother every brother wants to be. He shared a bond with his siblings that was rooted in joy, laughter, and unshakeable loyalty. Their conversations were filled with laughter, food, and memories. He kept in touch with cousins too, near and distant, through impromptu calls, surprise visits, and never missing a birthday. There was always a warmth in his relationships that made people feel special just by being around him. Your Dadu was the friend every friend wants to be. To him, friends were truly family. He made time for them, celebrated with them, stood by them in tough times, and never let distance or time weaken those bonds right from Kashmir to Tamil Nadu. The list of his friends was never-ending, and yet, he made each one feel like they were his best friend. People came to him not just for a laugh, but for comfort, and always for a warm hug. Your Dadu was the mamu and chachu every uncle wants to be. He was the go-to adult for all the kids in the extended family - someone they could talk to, laugh with, confide in. He showered his nephews and nieces with affection, endless hugs, and their favourite food. He never came empty-handed. His love was loud, open, and deeply felt. Your Dadu was the husband every husband should aspire to be. He was a constant companion to your Dadi. Through all the highs and lows of life, he stood besides her with humour, strength, and unwavering support. He celebrated her wins & shared her worries Their love wasn't just in words, it was in the everyday things. Your Dadu was the kind of father I hope I can be. He gave me the support to shape and chase my dreams, your foofy and I were spoilt for choices but yet he and maa always kept us grounded (I think). They always kept our needs first, and always gave us what we really wanted. Whenever I didn't know what to do, I would call him and he would do everything possible in the world to help me.
He found his peace in his daily pooja paath, Sunderkaand, Hanuman chalisa and his "Jai Shri Ram", and somehow shared that peace with everyone around him. His spirituality was a key aspect of his entire life.
And now, my dear Samarth, here's what I want you to know most of all:
There is no doubt in my mind (or anybody who knew him well) - Your Dadu would have been the most amazing Dadu in the world.
You would have been his little prince, his Golumal. He would've spoiled you endlessly! With food, hugs, stories, and laughter. He would've held you in his arms every morning, sung you bhajans, shown you the world on his shoulders, and told you all the stories of his pranks with his siblings and outings with your Dadi. He would've sat with you on the floor while you played, and been the first to cheer for you in everything you did.
I sometimes imagine the two of you together! and though it makes me smile, it also brings a tear. Because I know how lucky I was to have him, and how lucky you would have been too.
But here's what I promise you
I will try, every single day, to be the kind of father to you that he was to me. Loving, present, full of laughter, full of hugs. I may not get everything right, but I will never stop trying. Through me, I hope you will feel a little bit of his love too.
And someday, when you're older, if someone ever asks you what your father was like... I hope you smile and think of love, laughter, warmth, and lots of food & gifts. Just like I do when I think of your Dadu.
With all my love. Papa (Ashish Batra, Tony's Son)
Dear Papa, Soumya (Beti, Daughter-in-law)
(Page 14)
Seven years of knowing you, your love for a lifetime.. it will be impossible to recount what we shared through instances over these years, there were times you understood without me saying what I needed, there were times you asked "tu bol na beti.. ho jayega... there were times you took me by surprise with just how thoughtful one could be.
Words will fall short and no one needs any telling of what we had which was special in its own very strong way. You were always there, you will always be there. Samarth knows you, your love, your spirit, through your everlasting blessings.
How I wish you were here, how I still imagine so many times and re-live a few precious moments of my day with you around.
It is true the void is impossible to fill, but I will remind myself there was so much life you added to the years, I won't count the years to life.
Love and light to you always, Papa! Soumya (Beti, Daughter-in-law)
A Meethi Reet (Nikesh Masiwal, Beta, Son-in-Law)
(Page 15-17)
My first interaction with Papa was in 2018, one afternoon in my office. A new brief had come in from a client. Unsure if it was practical, I discussed it with Divya, who told me to call the best man for the job. Thinking he was speaking to Divya's boss, he took my call. I sent him images on WhatsApp. and Papa asked. "Yeh tum kaise karna chahte ho?" I said, "Mujhe nahi pata," and he guided me on practical additions to the Welcome Kit for Godrej Hicare. Little did I know it was also a Welcome Kit for me.. into Tony-ism and all the love to come.
Papa first came into my life in 2014-2015, when I travelled with Divya in the Metro. He'd call her exactly at JLN Stadium, Chandni Chowk, and Kashmere Gate to ask her location. As she went downstairs to him at Jahangirpuri, I tried catching fleeting glimpses, imagining a Bollywood-style Punjabi Papa with a jeep and moustache. The distance from where I stood was just a staircase away, but my assumptions were far off. Had I dared to follow Divya and say hi, I now know he would have taken me to the best chaat corner in Shalimar Bagh. Later, while working in printing, he told me, "Ek baar try kar lo aur print kar lo, kuch galat hua toh ek aur mauka milta hai- life ki sahi print mein."
In the years ahead, we worked on projects from Asian Paints to Synergy, and every client remembered him. Even one call left people thinking, "Kaam aur baat aise karo ke mulaqat ke baad bhi koi bhule na." When the day came that we actually spoke after Divya revealed of our relationship, he told me, 'Beta, mujhe pata tha tum hi ho jab meine pehli baat ki thi. Just like a forma in printing, it set the base to a chapter in my life that would have its imprint forever.
Meeting Papa and Mummy, finally, on 14th Feb 2021 was just as important. Nervous but excited, we met at NSP in Starbucks, later ending up at Pind Baluchi. While I sweated over papa's favorite hari mirch ke parathe, the meeting was filled with their questions, stories, and that ever-present love. Papa called it our anniversary each year, celebrating the start of a new bond. Divya was back in Mumbai, overthinking scenarios about the meeting, and we were sharing snaps Mummy and Papa asked me about work, hobbies, and family.. and of course, 'Aur kya khaoge? That meeting, with a bit of mirch in it, ended with a sweet selfie with Mummy and Papa that remains my favourite, and I'm glad we could recreate it after 2 years. Papa celebrated 14 Feb as "Happy Anniversary of us meeting for the coming years.
The next day, as I returned to Mumbai, Papa insisted on dropping me to the airport. I was looking at maps and we were clearly not on the path to go to the airport, which was confirmed when Papa stopped the car at a famous mithai shop, whose owner smiled and shook hands when he saw Papa. He ordered mithai and biscuits (for Divya), and as time went by the list became longer, my bag heavier, and time shorter for my check-in to close. Then I saw 'Mota Seth (Divya)' flashing on the screen, asking Papa to hurry.
On the way to the turning of IGI. a police guy stopped us for me not wearing a mask and asked for Rs 2000. I tried to make up stories, but Papa paid him off- which I was very unhappy about. Later, with overloaded luggage and lots of love, I flew to Mumbai after the first of many airport drop-offs by Papa. At that time, I did not know Papa's faith for Hanumanji, but as I look back, he practised acts of who he prayed to. Just like Hanumanji came to Ashok Vatika for Sita ji and acted not as a messenger, but as a comforter, warrior, and devotee, Papa followed that learning unknowingly with everyone. He would comfort and stand beside all the people he met. leaving a lasting imprint.
Our bond grew slowly but steadily. I did not like gifts, and he did not like me not taking them. So over the years, whenever he asked, "Beta kya laaun?", I would ask for any one thing. I knew he would add two or three more... but that's okay. I accepted his way of love. Today, there is nothing in my wardrobe that was bought by me as my first choice, all his. My hands go and pick something or anything that he picked for me.
He was the happiest when we shopped, went out eating, although he would do neither. He just liked giving it all. He never got upset or angry, except three times. First, when I wore the ring on the wrong finger during our ring ceremony. Second, when I kept my rudraksha on the side table, he said, Yeh pavitra cheez hai, aise nahi karte Third, during Shani puja at the mandir on Saturday. I can't count the number of times he had made us all smile. Someone who did not tell others his heart aches but would take part in giving joys to others. Like the one he prayed to, adored, and reminded others saying "Jai Shree Ram," he followed him to his last day- in choosing exile over ease, silence over rage, and virtue over vengeance.
We miss his morning messages, and Tuesday Sundarkaand where he used to sing प्रभु चरित्र सुनिबे को रसिया राम लखन सीता मन बसिया ॥"
It was in those moments that he was in his truest happy place, just as he was when handing out chocolates to children or when giving us gifts as though each one carried a piece of his heart, or during his reverent morning prayers to his Bajrang Bali..
I have only been blessed to know him for four short years, but in that time, he gave us a lifetime's worth of love, protection, and wisdom. There were days between 2023-2024 when he would come to pick me up at Jahangirpuri, in the same way he had done for Divya a decade earlier. Sometimes, I wish I had dared to meet him sooner. Perhaps I would have received more of his love, blessings, more time.
When his health started failing, we all prayed. We all hoped, chanting the Hanuman Chalisa and Mahamrityunjaya Mantra.
His farewell was silent. Like Hanuman departing from Sita, not with grand speeches, but with folded hands, moist eyes, and Ram's name in his heart, he left without saying "goodbye." Like in Sunderkaand "In serving and remembering Ram, there is no final parting, only a pause before the next meeting."
Now we just pray that whenever that next meeting is, this life or the next, it will be like those Tuesdays again, with his voice carrying the verses he loved so much.
To, Mere Papa With Love (Divya, Daughter)
(Page 18-20)
People often say I'm lucky to have had a father like you. I get what they mean... but sometimes I want to ask them, what kind of luck takes my papa away so soon? Many people say they have the best dad, mine actually was.
As a child, I have only a handful of memories of us... They are small, scattered snapshots.. little moments in shops where you would quietly get me the things I wanted, moments of you quietly providing, never saying much but always there. Some of my absolute happiest childhood memories come from the birthdays you and Mumma celebrated for me... both of you would put your heart and soul, jaan laga dete the.. in making each one special. Those celebrations, year after year, are the brightest, warmest lights in my early memories. In my teenage years, we didn't talk much about feelings or emotions, but care showed in daily actions, instead of words. Years later, you told me about the struggles you faced in your business... but you kept those burdens off my and Bhaiya's shoulders. Now, looking back, I understand the real strength it took for you to shield us from those worries.
I think real conversations between us began around the time I turned eighteen. The first time I really asked you for something directly - my first phone, a yellow Samsung Corby I was so nervous, unsure if I should even ask for something so specific. But you didn't say anything... you just came home the next evening and quietly handed me the exact phone I wanted. I was amazed. You never failed to drop me or pick me up from anywhere... I never understood the struggles of Delhi transportation, because my dad was always there, no matter how far, no matter how tired, you'd travel half an hour back from work just to make sure I had a ride. And then, as life unfolded, you kept showing your love in a thousand little ways...
When I was moving to Bombay, you didn't want me to leave. I was looking for independence after always being protected. You let me go, though it was hard. Looking back, I can see now... you always tried to keep me safe, protected me from more than I could understand, from negativity, from the world's storms, and for that, I will always be grateful. Our turning point was the lockdown. After years apart, suddenly we were living together again. I know you were happy to have me back, even if it was a hard time for me. When Dadaji passed away, I stayed. because I saw you needed me. That time was a blessing in disguise. I was ready for more independence but life brought us closer instead. Those bun maska mornings and carrom evenings became staple.
When I told you and ma about Nikesh, I was nervous, but you met my honesty with your own brand of caution and care. You said. "Mujhe toh pehle se hi laga tha" and there was an apprehension in your face the next few days- "Business se zyada job stable hoti hai, beta... I know where you came from. But soon as you met Nikesh, I got to witness something truly special, the way you opened your arms to him, how you welcomed him into our family, not just as a son-in-law but almost as your fourth child. You spoiled him the same way you always spoiled me. Yet, the two of you formed your own relationship. It was sweeter and easier than I could ever imagine... even watching you with my in-laws, never a push or pull relation, both sets of parents only nudging me to serve the other set - those were the moments I realized how easy you made my life. I know I used to feel torn between Delhi and Bombay, worried about balancing both families, but you made it all work with your grace and respect for others.
When Nikesh and I would visit Delhi, those visits became some of the best times. All the small things, sharing kathi rolls, Baljeet ke kulche, seeing Nikesh and you sitting together watching cheeky south Indian cinema, that sense of home came alive. Those images are etched in my heart. I wish we had more time....
And then life changed. You fell sick overnight, and I wasn't there to take you to the hospital. That became my first regret... the nightmare that came true. In the hospital, I saw a side of you I'd never fully known. At first, it seemed like you were just taking in the hospitality, but soon the pain set in and tested you in ways none of us could prepare for. Yet, you still woke up every morning with such faith, telling us, "Ramji sab bhali karenge." What were the odds that your room later overlooked Hanumanji ki moorty? During those first two months, we would take you in your wheelchair, and you'd bow your head... sometimes even recite the entire Hanuman Chalisa while looking out the window. Even in those hardest days, while others would have lost the will, you kept trying to bring joy to those around you, organizing Kanjak for the nurses, planning gifts for the doctors. I still do not know what drove you, Papa. Maybe nobody can know.
Right after you got discharged in October, my birthday came. I've had 32 birthdays in your lifetime. We were together for 29. But you never cut the cake with me. You were always behind the camera. You'd ask Dadaji or Dadima to do the honours, or tell me to get Mumma. Or pass the moment to whichever guest-of-honour was around. Later, when the nieces and nephews arrived, you made space for them. And then Nikesh entered your life, you made sure Nikesh was always beside me. But on my 32nd birthday, you finally let me have the honour of cutting the cake with you. You sat beside me. After the 2 stressful months of the hospital, I knew how precious it was, this simple joy, because we had come so close to losing it forever. I felt so blessed to have you there, so thankful for your faith, because that's what made you stay a little longer. even when things looked impossible.
So The Faith. How did you hold on to it the way you did? Even in pain. Even when nothing was clear. Anyone who met you in the hospital was struck by your strength: how you kept pushing past every low. The first hospital stay felt like Avengers: Infinity War- chaotic, uncertain, full of tension. The second... that was Endgame- heavier, darker. Your faith, once unshakeable, began to waver. Yet, somehow, you still grounded all of us. I remember you calming bhai and me with, "Beta, trust them." But I won't. Because we lost our Tony in this endgame. Even as your body began to give up, your will didn't. Every now and then, we'd catch glimpses of the old you your jokes, your undeniable spirit, your way of lightening the mood.
I often wonder if you, too, felt betrayed by God. You no longer wanted to visit Hanumanji in later weeks. Even when we tried. And still, you kept teaching us. "Kisi ke paise nahin rokne chahiye." "Jo bhi kaam karo, acche se karo." "Be happy, be cheerful." You smiled at bhaiya after being resuscitated. You waited for the prayers to end before leaving your body.
You were, and always will be, God's child.
The only lesson you tried to teach me was driving, but I learned so much more by watching you. How to stay close even after a fight, how to be present no matter how busy or tired, how to truly put love into action every day. You worked tirelessly, never slowing down, but you always made time for people. Now, as an adult, I understand, it wasn't perfectionism, it was love. Every small gesture was your way of caring for us.
If there is just one thing I could hold on to, it would be the everyday things. The way you made tea, how you played carrom, how you wrapped us in hugs at the airport, how you hesitated with new things, but still you gave them your all... typing, video editing, cooking, driving lessons... your patience. All of it lives in me. Your art of capturing beauty in little moments, just like you did with your old camera... I carry it forward with this book, with every page I write. I try to bottle up your kindness and warmth and send it out into the world.
You are, and always will be, my biggest blessing.
Thank you, Papa... for loving me unconditionally, patiently, and always... in your beautiful way.
Love always, Mota Seth (Divya, Daughter)

The Best of All of Us - An Interview with Tony's Elder Brother - Jitendra Kumar Batra
(Page 24-25)
Q: What was your relationship like? Through all his and my life Tony was especially close to me. Tony mere sukh dukh sabka saathi tha. Last twenty years - I think were the best for us together. He not only lived close by, but was the most important part of my family. I don't think I have made any important decision in last two decades without Tony's presence. Be it for Abhishek's college, buying this house, Shweta's marriage, Abhishek's marriage, and even more so in difficult times when Madhu wasn't well. I don't think we would have survived the Covid lock down without Tony's cheerful presence every day. He was more like my eldest son, more than my youngest brother.
Q: Which of his qualities stood out to you the most? Unconditional Love and Generosity of Heart
Q: What are your other fondest memories of him? This one time when Abhishek was in Pune, Abhi wanted to get a bike for himself. Though I wasn't directly involved, between Tony, Shweta and Abhishek they chalked out a plan on how to convince me. Tony ne pehla cheque bheja tha.. Bus mujhse final delivery lene se pehle permission li. This happened so often.. Whenever Shweta or Abhishek were wary of approaching me for something.. It was always through Tony. Tony was not only my lifeline but their life line too.
You were the best of all of us - gentler. wiser. somehow always more kind. more joyful. more present. The one who made us laugh and held us together without even trying. I still look for you. Every morning when the bell rings. every time I go downstairs wondering if I will run into you.. in the silence that now fills my heart. You were my younger brother. but also my teacher. my mirror. You were.. my heart walking outside me. -J K Batra Elder Brother "The Best of All of Us"
Q: You saw him grow from a boy into a husband. father. and grandfather. What changed. and what never did? I think the biggest change in his personality happened when mummy papa went to live with him. I think he became the most responsible of all of us overnight. He was so sincere and dedicated towards his work and making sure his family was taken care of. Poonam supported him all the way. They both worked really hard to carve out a beautiful life for themselves and their children. Q: What was his biggest strength? And weakness? His biggest strength was his unshakeable faith in God.. His devotion was unparalleled. Biggest weakness कहो या उसकी खुशी... बस दुनिया की सेवा करने में लगा था मेरा भाई!!
A Tribute to Tony - by Pushpinder Kumar Batra a.k.a. PKB, Elder Brother
(Page 26-27)
Tony was born on 18th August 1959. a Rakhi day, a coincidence that would later come to define how central he became to our family celebrations. Eleven years younger than me. I practically helped raise him. earning the nickname "आधी मां" (half-mother). One vivid memory still makes me laugh: he'd sit on my lap, only to immediately relieve himself all over me- a ritual so regular it became a running family joke. Mischief and Memories In the mid-70s. we lived in Ramesh Nagar. One Sunday, we kids- me. J.K.. Tony. and Neena- were determined to lure our father home early from the temple. "Your friend Mr. Bhalla has come to see you." we told him. Puzzled, he returned home, only to find a bowl of Dahi Bhallas waiting. "Here's Mr. Bhalla!" we laughed. To our relief. he joined in. laughing along with us. It was one of those joyful. mischievous moments that defined our childhood. A Bold Beginning After graduating around 1977-78, the family considered Tony's future. Rather than to push him into a job. we encouraged him to try his hand at business. Despite our Father's reservations - "पहले साल हट्टी होता है. दूसरे साल चट्टी. तीसरे साल खट्टी" we believed in giving Tony time to grow. He entered the printing business with Mr. Rajeev Dave. becoming the first entrepreneur in the Batra family. With support from J.K. and Pinky. Tony began securing clients like schools and Godrej Industries. His meticulous nature ensured high-quality work. and he became the unofficial family printer, even for wedding invitations - a service he offered with love, never charging us a rupee. He ran his business with honesty, humility, and heart - paying his suppliers on time, never overcharging, and treating his employees with warmth and respect. A Man of Heart Tony had a rare ability to stay genuinely connected with everyone, across generations. From our father's peers to their great-grandchildren, he was a steady, loving presence. Children especially adored him. He never arrived without snacks or gifts. even when parents protested. His home was a place of welcome. He was a generous host, especially on Rakhi and Tikka. which he and Poonam hosted year after year at Shalimar Bagh. These gatherings were legendary- filled with love. laughter. and Dahi Bhallas in the evening. just as our parents liked it. Unshakable Strength and Support Tony never said no to anyone in need. He helped siblings and relatives alike, often without being asked, and without expecting anything in return. He regularly visited family, always bringing sweets or savory treats along. He was also the rock behind our parents' care. From doctor visits to daily needs. he handled everything with utmost dedication. His devotion was total. a lesson in selflessness for all of us. A Spiritually Committed Soul Tony's mornings began with hours of prayer. He was strongly committed to our family's spiritual traditions fasting regularly. performing Navratri rituals, hosting Ramayan Path over 9 days. growing Khetri hosting Kanjak, visits to Fazilka, regularly sponsoring langar at Shalimar Bagh Gurudwara on all important occasions/ punyatithis etc. all of this he did with the same sincerity that our parents had. I often said he was the true spiritual heir of our parents, perhaps even more devoted than they were. He also built his own traditions especially the monthly visit to Salasar and went on the Amarnath Yatra too! Ram Dullare After our father's passing. Tony started a Sunderkand Path every Tuesday. It was covid time, so it was on Zoom. This ritual which he started weekly at home. grew into the inclusive "Ram Dullare" group. an online Satsang where family members from across Mumbai. Faridabad. Meerut. Delhi, and even the USA gathered every week to pray, sing, and just connect with each other and have fun. Only Tony could make such an impossible feat possible- bringing together a dispersed family, week after week - simply driven by devotion. by love and by the togetherness that gave everyone joy. The sessions ended with bhajans, where everyone sang Pinky Bhai with Hanuman Chalisa. Baby with "Bhog Laga Le Thakura." Chachi Ji's Pratibha's and Kamla ji's singing. and Saroj Auntie joining from the USA. My own singing journey began here, with Tony's favorite "Tera Mangal..." and his unforgettable "Pritu Maat Pita..." "Ram Dullare" is Tony's legacy a space that we hope to continue to hold together. Tony's Legacy Tony wasn't just a brother, uncle, or son. He was the glue that held us all together with laughter, love, and unwavering support. His absence will be felt greatly, especially on Rakhi. the day that marked both his birth and the family's favorite celebration. But his presence in the way we gather, care for each other, and keep traditions alive will always remain.
Mera Tony - An Interview with Tony's Elder Sister - Neena Chawla
(Page 28-29)
प्रश्नः उनमें सबसे विशेष गुण कौनसे थे? निस्वार्थ सबको प्रेम करना, बड़ों के प्रति समर्पण, दूसरों को खिलाने का आनंद, और दिल की उदारता। ये सभी गुण उसे औरों से अलग बनाते थे।
प्रश्नः कोई ऐसा किस्सा या घटना बताइए, जिसमें यह गुण सबसे ज़्यादा झलका हो? जब भी घर में कोई बीमार होता, पता नहीं कैसे टोनी को इसकी खबर लग जाती थी। अपना काम छोड़कर मिलने आता। चाहे सिर्फ़ 10 मिनट रुकता, लेकिन उस में भी अपनी सकारात्मक ऊर्जा और मुस्कान से सबका दिल खुश कर देता था। उसके साथ होने से ही जैसे सब ठीक हो जाता था।
प्रश्नः उनके साथ आपकी सबसे प्यारी यादें कौन-सी हैं? मेरी पहली याद है 18 अगस्त 1959 की। वो रक्षाबंधन का दिन था, और टोनी का जन्म हुआ। हम सब घर पर ही थे जब ये हुआ, और मेरी ख़ुशी का ठिकाना नहीं था। बेबी और मैं तो बस नाचते- झूमते रह गए कि भगवान ने रक्षाबंधन के दिन हमें हमारा भाई भेजा है। मैं उसे गोदी में लेकर यहाँ- वहाँ घुमाती थी, और हमारा ये प्यारा रिश्ता साल दर साल और भी गहरा होता गया।
टोनी और खाने का बहुत गहरा रिश्ता है। आपकी क्या यादें हैं इसमें? टोनी को खाने की शर्त लगाने का बहुत शौक था। अंशु के साथ कितनी इडली खानी है, रसगुल्ले, और पता नहीं क्या-क्या। जब हम घर जाते थे, तो वह हमेशा गोलगप्पे और टिक्की लेकर आता था। खुद टोनी को खाने में बैंगन का भरता पसंद था, ब्रेड की मोटी वाली आखिरी स्लाइस के साथ। और उसे दाल-चावल और कढ़ी पसंद थी। राजमा और छोले उसे पसंद नहीं थे।
प्रश्नः कोई ऐसी चीज़ जिससे आपको उनकी याद आए? यादें तो बहुत हैं, अब जो सामने हैं वो याद ज़ादा याद रह जाती हैं। टोनी ने मुझे बहुत सी यादगार चीजें दी हैं। मेरा सबसे प्यारा सूट, जो वो मेरे 70वें जन्मदिन पर स्पेशल लाया था। ख़ास गीर गाय का ख़ास देसी घी, और कच्ची घानी की सरसों का तेल। ये सब उसकी प्यार भरी सोच का ही तो सबूत हैं।
प्रश्नः आपने उन्हें एक लड़के से पति, पिता और फिर दादा बनते देखा। इस सफर में क्या बदला और क्या कभी नहीं बदला ? टोनी का हंसमुख स्वभाव कभी नहीं बदला। साल दर साल अगर कुछ बदला, तो वो था उसका ईश्वर के प्रति गहरा होता विश्वास और भक्ति भाव।
प्रश्नः उनकी सबसे बड़ी ताकत और सबसे बड़ी कमज़ोरी क्या थी? उसकी सबसे बड़ी ताकत थी सबको बिना भेदभाव के प्रेम देना, हर किसी का ध्यान रखना, और कभी क्रोधित न होकर शांत स्वर में समझाना। जहाँ तक कमज़ोरी की बात है, मैंने उसमें कोई कमी कभी नहीं देखी।
कुछ और चीजें जो आपको याद हैं? क्या कुछ चीजें जो आप उनके साथ और करना चाहती थीं? मैं टोनी के साथ और रहना चाहती थी। कई बार उसने कहा कि घर आ जा, पर मैं कम जाती थी। जब देश में इमरजेंसी हुई थी, तब हम साथ रहे थे। तब भी टोनी ने बहुत ध्यान रखा था। न जाने कहां से समोसे ले आता था। रुचि तब दो साल की थी, उसके लिए ढूंढ-ढूंढ कर दूध लेकर आता था।

(Page 30-31)
प्रश्नः उनमें सबसे विशेष गुण कौन-से थे? उसका दिल इतना उदार था, क्या ही बताऊँ ! प्रश्नः आप यह बताओ कोई ऐसा किस्सा या घटना बताइए, जिसमें यह गुण सबसे ज़्यादा झलका हो। कोई भी फंक्शन हो, शादी हो, किसी के बच्चा हुआ हो, किसी के भी घर में कोई भी ख़ुशी हो, वो ऐसे खुश होता जैसे उसके अपने घर में हुई हो। और बस महसूस ही नहीं करता, वैसे ही बिहेव भी करता था। मुझे इस बात की बहुत तसल्ली है कि वो अंत तक ये ख़ुशियाँ महसूस करता रहा।
प्रश्नः आपका रिश्ता सबसे अच्छा कब था? जब हमारी माँ चली गई ना, मुझे लगता है तब से हम और क्लोज़ हो गए। शायद इसलिए भी क्योंकि मैं भी उनसे बहुत अटैच्ड थी, और टोनी भी। हम दोनों का हाल ये था कि कुछ भी होता, बस रोने लगते। एक दिन टोनी बोला, "देखता हूँ, पहले किसके आँसू सूखते हैं।" मैंने भी कहा, "ठीक है, देखते हैं!" पर सच कहूँ तो हम एक-दूसरे से आँख भी नहीं मिला पाते थे। आज भी, मार्च से मैं पूनम से आँख नहीं मिला पा रही हूँ। माँ के बाद जब भी हम मिलते, टोनी और मैं बस एक नज़र मिलते ही आँसू निकल आते थे। उन महीनों में फ़ोन पर भी बात करते तो भी रोते रहते थे। उसी समय से हमारा अटैचमेंट और गहरा हो गया। फिर जैसे-तैसे उन के जाने का दुःख सहा, कुछ साल बाद नया घर लिया। 2016 में टीना के पापा चले गए, उसके बाद तो टोनी ने हमें थाम लिया। ऐसा सहारा बना कि मैं आधी रात को भी फ़ोन करूँ, तो आकर खड़ा हो जाए। हमें फिर से खड़ा करने में उसका बहुत बड़ा हाथ था। (और फिर खुद ही भाग गया...)
प्रश्नः उनके साथ आपकी सबसे प्यारी यादें कौन-सी हैं? मेरी शादी के बाद मेरा ऑफिस CGO कॉम्प्लेक्स में था, और भाई का काम उस समय लोधी रोड पर था। हफ़्ते में एक न एक दिन वो घर से कुछ न कुछ लेके आ ही जाता था। माँ कुछ बना के देती थी मेरे लिए, और ये इतने प्यार से ऑफिस आ जाता था देने। मेरे ऑफिस के लोग आज भी उसे याद करते हैं। माँ के जाने के बाद का पहला त्यौहार, पिताजी के साथ सभी भाई-बहनों ने मिलकर मनाया, माँ को याद करते हुए। Lohri 2013, Shalimar Bagh
"माँ चालीगयी, बाप चला गया, इतना बुरा नहीं लगा। लेकिन जब यह गया, मेरा छोटा भाई, तब लग रहा है हम अनाथ होगये... ....शालीमार बाघ जाती हूँ तो खड़ा ही नहीं हुआ जाता, ऐसा लगता है अभी फोटो से निकल के कहेगा "तू आयी नहीं इतने दिन से?".... .... आखरी दिनों में कितना कहता रहा के, तुझे देख के ऐसा लगरहा है जैसे मेरी माँ आगयी है। मुझे मन करता था मैं वैसे ही उसका ध्यान रखें।"
प्रश्नः आपने उन्हें एक लड़के से पति, पिता और फिर दादा बनते देखा। इस सफर में क्या बदला और क्या कभी नहीं बदला ? जो कभी नहीं बदला वो था उसका प्यार, सबके लिए। लोगों में एक तरह का प्यार होता है.. किसी में परिवार का, किसी में दोस्तों का, किसी में बच्चों का। इसमें सबके लिए इतना प्यार भरा था के झलकता रहता था, अलग अलग तरीकों से । जो बदला - वो था उसका गुस्सा, बाद में काफ़ी आने लगा था, पर control बहुत करता था। दबा लेता था अपना गुस्सा।
प्रश्नः उनकी सबसे बड़ी ताकत और सबसे बड़ी कमज़ोरी क्या थी? उनकी सबसे बड़ी ताकत थी उनकी willpower! 2001 में जब उसे स्ट्रोक हुआ था, उसके बाद उसने अपना lifestyle कैसे बदला था, सबको दिखा था। गज़ब की willpower थी उसमें। अपने आखरी 6 महीने में भी उसने जितना सहन किया है, इतनी भयानक बीमारियों से गुज़रते हुए, वो बहुत कम लोगों को पता है। ऐसी बीमारी में भी 6 महीने निकाले उसने, हँसते हँसते, अपने काम करते करते, यह ही तो संकल्प है। उसकी कमज़ोरी- दूसरों को खिलाओ, और खुद भूखे रहो।
Uncle by Blood, Brother by Bond - An Interview with Tony's Uncle - Mr Surendra Pal Batra
(Page 32-33)
Uncle by blood. brother by bond: Q: Which of his qualities stood out to you the most? Tony's nature was truly remarkable. His ability to give unconditionally, to care deeply without being asked, and to be there for people, that's what I'll always remember. He lived with integrity, with loyalty, and with a generous heart. If I ever needed anything, my first thought was, "Let me call Tony" And no matter what, his response was always positive. He had this deep-rooted dedication to family, to friends, to doing the right thing.
Q: Can you share a story where this quality really came through? One memory that stands out is my son Neeraj's wedding. Being outside India, it was a big deal for me to coordinate everything. For me, it felt like a massive favour, but for Tony, it wasn't. He made the necessary calls, got things done, and made sure everything went smoothly. That's the kind of support that changes everything for someone living far away.
I also remember how, nearly 20 years ago, during Nisha's wedding in India, he brought the whole family together, even Papaji. That gesture meant the world to me. At a time when even sending money online wasn't easy, Tony made sure the wedding card reached me. Those may seem like small things, but they brought a sense of belonging and connection that was priceless.
Q: When was your relationship at its best? It was in the last 15-20 years, especially thanks to technology. We spoke often, atleast 2-3 times a month, whenever possible. As adults, the bond grew deeper. Over time, we started calling each other "bhai", because that's what our relationship felt like.
Q: What are your other fondest memories of him? Tony had a way of keeping the family connected. He once made me memorize who's who in the family, whose children are doing what, just to keep me updated and close.
If I had an issue with my health, like arthritis, he'd suggest remedies. He paid attention to the little things.
You know, even during his illness, he never let on that he was struggling. He was always in good spirits, never complaining, never negative. Once, I called and he said he couldn't talk because he was watching cricket and I found such comfort in that. It showed me that he was still enjoying life in his own way, not wanting to be a burden on anyone.
Q: You saw him grow into a husband. father. and grandfather. What changed, and what never did? He grew into every role with full dedication. But what never changed was his temperament always calm, always positive. He never showed anger, not even in times of stress. He was the kind of person who didn't react instantly; he took his time, responded thoughtfully. That's a rare quality.
Q: What was his biggest strength? And weakness? His greatest strength was the grace he carried, something only God can give. He lived a very spiritual life. He was even more devoted than RR ji, and was a founding member of the Ram Dullare Bhajan Mandli. As for weaknesses, I truly can't think of any. There was nothing lacking in him, at least not that he ever let show.
Q: Is there something that you think the readers should remember about him? He left behind something truly wonderful. The way he lived- always smiling, always caring, is something people should remember. He brought the family together and made everyone feel seen. What I hope people carry forward from his life is the value he placed on relationships. Maintaining bonds, staying calm under pressure, showing up without making noise about it, these are not easy things, but he did them with ease. No one can replace him. But I do see Balli trying to fill some of those roles.. and that effort is something I deeply acknowledge. He left too soon. He shouldn't have gone when he did. But what he's left behind is full of meaning and warmth. He was a good husband, a devoted father.. and most of all, a truly exceptional human being.

टोनी बेटा- मेरे बड़े भाई, जिन्हें हम डैडीजी कहते थे, का बेटा था। वो मुझे बहुत प्यार करता था। आते ही मेरे पांव छूता था, और मना करने पर कहता, 'बहनों का आशीर्वाद तो बहुत ज़रूरी है।' डॅडीजी के जाने के बाद से, वो मुझे अपनी बुआ न कहकर बहन ही कहता था और मुझसे राखी-टिक्का भी करवाता था। जब भी वो हमारे घर आता, तो बहुत सारी खाने की चीजें लेकर आता था, और मना करने पर कहता, 'बहनों के यहाँ भी कोई खाली हाथ जाता है?' जब वो छोटा था, तो मैं उसे अपने साथ गाड़ी में खूब घुमाती थी। वो बहुत ही अच्छे और मीठे स्वभाव का था, और मुझे बहुत प्यारा था। भगवान उसकी आत्मा को शांति दे।
TONY TAYA - Mr Purushottam Lal Batra, Tony's Chacha
(Page 34)
We were very sad to hear the news of the untimely demise of our dear nephew Tony. who was the youngest child of my eldest brother, Late Shri Ram Rang Batra. He died a few months shy of his 66th birthday. We sadly anticipated the passing of our older brother in his 90s, but never imagined that it would be our beloved nephew who would leave us, being robbed of a whole life ahead of him. We remember the day when he was released from the hospital after the first phase of treatment. We were immensely happy to see the video of the family celebrating the homecoming of TONY TAYA (lovingly called by the grandchildren) in a cake-cutting ceremony. We could imagine a day of such heartbreak and pain for his wife, POONAM, and the rest of his family. We in the US knew there was nothing we could say or do to alleviate or dissipate such profound grief experienced by his son and daughter and their families. Whenever Kamlesh and I had come to Delhi, Tony was there to meet and greet us with a smile and extend any help we needed. We questioned why this happened, and what this devoted son did to deserve this punishment. Thinking of all this, we cannot stop the tears from flowing down our cheeks. He should be remembered as being a person who exemplified pure joy. He was always seeing things positively and was someone who looked for and found the goodness in people. He set that example for all of his elders even, and put in context what we can all strive for. May Tony Taya's memory be a blessing, and may his brothers, sisters, and his family have the needed support and strength to cope with all the pain and grief.

मैं टोनी की बंसी आंटी यानी मामी वो टोनी जो एक ऐसी हस्ती थी जो याद करते ही रहो। ऐसे लोग जो कभी भुलाए नहीं जा सकते, जो विरले ही होते हैं। भगवान का भक्त, बालाजी का भक्त - सबसे ज्यादा नित नेम वाला। परिवार में सबसे छोटा पर सबसे प्यार करने वाला सबसे प्यारा। जब भी मैं फोन करती दूसरी तरफ से आवाज आती "जय सियाराम !” अब नम आंखों से दर्द भरे दिल से किसे पुकारूं। बहुत मन दुखता है। टोनी जब भी आता बहुत सारी चीजें लेकर आता - कहता, आंटीजी यह खा लो वो खा लो। उसका स्वाद अलग है! यह बहुत अच्छा है! यह भी खाओ, यह प्रसाद है, यह तो खाना ही पड़ेगा ! एक बार तो बाहर से ही आवाज लगाई- "आंटी जी बाहर आओ! मैं बाहर गई तो बाहर चमचमाती नई गाड़ी खड़ी थी, बोला, "आओ आंटी इसमें बैठो मैंने नई गाड़ी ली है!” मुझे बिठाकर मेरे कंपाउंड में दो चक्कर लगवाए। मैं जब टोनी के घर जाऊं तो कितनी चीजें मंगा लेता कि आपको क्या खिलाऊं। सब तरह का फल नमकीन मीठा आगे ला कर रख देता और खिलाता रहता। अंतिम बार भी जब उससे मिली तो उसने मुझे कितना कुछ खिलाया और इतनी सारी हाजमे की गोलियां भी दी। कि आप ले जाओ फिर एक सूट भी मेरे को दिया कि यह तो लेना ही पड़ेगा। मैं उसको बहुत याद करती हूँ। ईश्वर उसकी आत्मा को अपने चरणों में स्थान दे और वो जहां भी रहे सुखी रहे।
TONY BETA - Mrs Krishna Batra, Tony's Dear Chachi
(Page 36)
"टोनी एक मज़ेदार, ईमानदार और भक्ति-भाव वाला बेटा था। जब भी कोई कुछ कहता, फटाफट हो जाता था। उसके शब्द ऐसे थे कि एक बार कहने की ज़रूरत पड़ती थी, काम अपने आप हो जाता था, दोबारा कहने की ज़रूरत नहीं पड़ती थी। किसी भी धार्मिक स्थान पर जाते, तो वो बैठकर पूजा करता। आपकी कमी कोई भी पूरी नहीं कर पाएगा। आप जितने भी काम करते, अच्छे से अच्छे, बढ़िया करते थे। ईश्वर की प्राप्ति के लिए बहुत मेहनत करते थे। जहाँ भी रहो, खुश रहो, सुखी रहो... यही ईश्वर से प्रार्थना है।"

टोनी भाई और मैने तो इतना समय बचपन में साथ बिताया कि अगर सारे किस्से सुनाने लगूं, तो पूरी किताब भर जाएगी। लेकिन मैं आपको एक-दो किस्से बताता हूँ। एक बार जब हम शायद 15-16 साल के थे, हम रमेश नगर में रहते थे। हमारी ड्यूटी लगी कि हम बिमला दीदी के पिताजी, यानी हमारे ताया जी के यहां शकूर बस्ती दिवाली देकर आएं। हमने आपस में यह तय किया कि हम सुबह-सुबह वहां जाकर दिवाली दे आएंगे और फिर विशाल सिनेमा में मॉर्निंग शो देखेंगे। ज़ाहिर सी बात है, मूवी का काम चुपके-चुपके होना था। वहां पहुंचे तो उन लोगों ने बड़ी मिन्नत की कि कुछ नाश्ता कर लो, लेकिन हमें तो पिक्चर देखनी थी, वो भी कोई ऐसी-वैसी नहीं, पिक्चर थी "प्रेम कहानी", जिसमें शशि कपूर और मुमताज़ थे। हमने उन्हें बहाना बनाया कि हमें और भी बहुत जगह जाना है। वहां से निकलकर हम साइकिल पर विशाल सिनेमा पहुंचे और बड़े मज़े से पिक्चर देखकर घर लौटे। जब घर में बड़ी मम्मीजी (टोनी की मम्मी) ने पूछा, "इतनी देर क्यों हो गई? सवेरे सात बजे से गए हो, अब एक बज गया है," तो हमने झूठ बोल दिया कि "वो हमें आने ही नहीं दे रहे थे, बहुत खिलाया उन्होंने।" अब बड़ी मम्मी ने हमें लंच नहीं दिया। फिर हम मेरे घर आए, लेकिन वहां भी मम्मी घर पर नहीं थीं। अब क्या करें... भूख बहुत लगी थी पर धोबी के कुत्ते जैसा महसूस हो रहा था! न घर के रहे थे, न घाट के। जेब में पैसे देखे तो उतने ही थे कि मार्केट जाकर एक प्लेट छोले-भटूरे लेकर शेयर कर सके। फिर घर वापस आए और मम्मीजी से कहा, “हमें भूख लगी है, कुछ खाने को दे दो।” फिर उन्होंने हमें खाना खिलाया... और हमारी प्रेम कहानी पूरी हुई। उस दिन तो हमने यही सीखा कि आगे से झूठ नहीं बोलेंगे। अगर खाना खाया तो बोलेंगे कि खाया, और नहीं खाया तो साफ़ कहेंगे कि नहीं खाया। झूठ बोलकर भूखे नहीं रहेंगे। उस फिल्म का एक गाना मुझे अभी भी याद है: "प्रेम कहानी में इक लड़का होता है, एक लड़की होती है, कभी दोनों हँसते हैं, कभी दोनों रोते हैं..." तो यह थी मेरी और टोनी की प्रेम कहानी, जो हमने साथ रहकर ज़्यादातर हँसते हुए और कभी-कभी रोते हुए भी बिताई।
एक और बहुत ही इंटरेस्टिंग किस्सा है मेरे और टोनी के लड़कपन का। साल था 1974। गुड्डी दीदी और रंजीत जीजाजी की सगाई हो चुकी थी और जीजाजी गुड्डी दीदी से मिलने आते रहते थे। उनके पास एक ऑरेंज कलर की लूना हुआ करती थी। तुम बच्चों ने तो शायद लूना का नाम भी नहीं सुना होगा। यह एक तरह से साइकिल का काफी advanced version होता था, पहले पैडल से स्टार्ट करना होता था और फिर accelerator दबाना होता था और वो अपने आप चलती थी। जब रंजीत जीजाजी आते थे और होने वाले दामाद के लिए खास चाय वाय का इंतज़ाम हो जाता था, तो हम, यानी मैं और टोनी, एक दूसरे को आंखों ही आंखों में इशारे करते थे कि जीजाजी से चाबी मांग, लूना की सैर करके आते हैं और दोस्तों पर रोब डालते हैं कि हमारे जीजाजी के पास लूना है। हम उनसे पूछ के चाबी लेके जाते और नीचे जाके थोड़ी बहस होती कि कौन चलाएगा? दोनों ही "पहले मैं, पहले मैं" करते, फिर हम दोनों हेड एंड टेल्स कर के डिसाइड करते कि कौन आगे बैठेगा और कौन पीछे। एक दिन ऐसे ही जीजाजी आए और टोनी मुझे मेरे घर से बुला लाया कि "आजा, मैं चाबी ले आया हूँ। हम दोनों ने आधा घंटा मस्ती मारी और क्योंकि जीजाजी को उस दिन जल्दी लौटना था, हम वापिस घर की तरफ चले। पर जल्दी के चक्कर में एक लेफ्ट टर्न लेते ही लूना स्किड कर गई और लेफ्ट की तरफ गिर गई। उसका एक पैडल बिल्कुल टूट गया। अब डर के मारे हमारी हालत खस्ता, कि घर में डांट पड़ेगी, होने वाले "जिज्जा जी" की लूना तोड़ दी !! अब ठीक भी कराएं तो कैसे। जेब में एक धेला नहीं, साइकिल वाले से बड़ी मिन्नतें करी, कि भाई पैडल ठीक कर दे, पैसे कल दे देंगे; पर उसका दिल नहीं पसीजा, और हम बुझे मन से लूना घर तक ले आए। अब घर आकर हमने लूना गेट के सामने लेफ्ट की तरफ गिरा दी और भोले बनकर ऊपर चले गए। जब जीजाजी नीचे आए तो घर के सब लोग भी उनको नीचे छोड़ने आए, और लूना गिरी हुई देखकर हैरान हो गए। हमने बड़ी मासूमियत से अंजान बनते हुए बोला कि "अरे यह लूना किसने गिरा दी!!" "और पैडल तोड़ दिया?!!" अभी तो हम ठीक ठाक खड़ी करके गए थे। उसी समय साइकिल वाले को बुलाया गया और पैडल ठीक कराया गया। किस्मत अच्छी थी कि यह वह साइकिल वाला नहीं था जिसके पास हम गए थे। लेकिन बाद में भैया लोगों ने हमें खूब डांटा कि "हमें पता है कि यह नुकसान तुमसे ही हुआ होगा और तुम झूठ बोल रहे हो" ... शुक्र है जीजाजी के सामने इज्जत बच गई पर उसके बाद भी हम लूना की सैर करते रहे (मगर थोड़े ध्यान से)
A Double Date in 1988 - Poonam Mohinder Batra, Bhabhi of Tony
(Page 42)
The first time Tony Bhaiya and Poonam Bhabhi met me was in 1988. We went to Kwality Restaurant, a very famous and expensive place at the time. That was Tony Bhaiya for you, always a little extravagant. He chose that place because it was right opposite Bank of Baroda. Parliament Street, where Poonam Bhabhi was working. That made it easier for her to join us. That was one of his qualities. He always found practical ways to make things work for everyone. During the cheerful conversation. Bhaiya casually asked me what my favourite vegetable dish was. I thought for a moment and said. "Bhindi." All three of them started laughing. I was confused. Had I said something funny? Then Tony Bhaiya told me. "Your would-be husband is fondly nicknamed 'Bhindi' at home. Daddyji gave him that name!"
Man of Surprises - Poonam Mohinder Batra, Bhabhi of Tony
(Page 43)
"During our sagan ceremony. Tony Bhaiya had a big beard. but later when the baraat came, he suddenly appeared without a beard - barely recognisable - and everyone was so surprised at the changed look and clean-shaven face! Jatinder Jijaji gave him an as Tonyshed look. and they both started dancing in pure enjoyment! It was a beautiful moment, caught by the photographer. Later on, I came to know that in his own marriage also. he had done the same trick! On the marriage day, he had a long beard and a rugged look. like a Majnu. and till the time he went to get ready for the reception, he had the same look. But when he entered the reception hall. he was simply clean-shaven surprising every guest! Even Poonam Bhabhi didn't know he was going to change his look! That was his way of making people happy- by surprising them with his simple tricks!"
Blessings to Tony - Ranjit Chawla, Brother-in-Law
(Page 44)
Tony was the most simple. loving and humble person that has walked on this earth. He was hardworking and found his soulmate in Poonam. He was the best younger brother for me. always standing by my side through thick and thin. He would give me special attention every time or anywhere we met - either alone or with the family. Even though he never took any drinks, he would always keep a bottle hidden in his house for me. God has been very selfish in calling him to his holy abode, we miss him. I miss him and wish him love and blessings in his after life.

टोनी भैया की जितनी भी तारीफ की जाए, कम है। वो थे तो मेरे चाचा के बेटे, लेकिन मेरे लिए सगे भाई से भी बढ़कर थे और मैं उन्हें अपना भाई ही कहती थी। मेरे दोनों बच्चों की शादियों में उन्होंने मेरी पूरी मदद की। अगर वो मदद नहीं करते, तो मेरे बच्चों की शादियाँ इतनी अच्छी तरह से नहीं हो पातीं। जब भी कुछ पूछती कि "भाई, यह कैसे करना है?" तो वो कहते, "हो जाएगा, चिंता न कर और बता क्या चाहिए।" वो मेरी हौसला अफज़ाई करते और सब जगह भाई का फ़र्ज़ निभाते। नेहा की शादी में उन्होंने अपने हाथ से चूड़ा पहनाया, फलों के टोकरे बनवाए, मेवे का थाल, मिठाई की टोकरियाँ - सभी काम वो अपने जिम्मे ले लेते और बखूबी निभाते। ऐसा भाई बहुत मुश्किल से मिलता है, लेकिन बहुत दुख है कि वो बहुत जल्दी चले गए। दोनों बच्चों को उन्होंने इतना प्यार दिया। वो जब भी स्कूल जाते, नेहा से मिलते और उसे सालासर का प्रसाद और खाने-पीने की चीजें देकर आते। एक बार वो स्कूल आए तो गाड़ी नहीं लेकर आए थे, तो नेहा को उन्होंने मेट्रो स्टेशन छोड़ने को बोला। लेकिन गाड़ी में बैठते ही बोले, "मार्केट की तरफ ले लो," और फिर गोपाला रेस्टोरेंट से नेहा के बेटे के लिए खाने-पीने का सामान लिया। नेहा के मना करने पर बोले, "तेरा बेटा मुझे पहली बार मिला है, उसे खाली कैसे जाने दूं?" नेहा के in-laws भी उनकी बहुत तारीफ और इज़्ज़त करते थे। वो एक बार अपने किसी रिश्तेदार से मिलने शालीमार बाग गए हुए थे, तो टोनी भैया उनको शालीमार बाग मार्केट में मिल गए। वो जबरदस्ती उनको एक रेस्टोरेंट में लेकर गए और नाश्ता करवाने के बाद ही उन्हें जाने दिया। ऐसे थे टोनी भैया - नेकदिल, खुशमिज़ाज, सबकी सेवा करने वाले, और रिश्ते बनाने व निभाने वाले भी। भगवान उनकी आत्मा को शांति दे और अपने चरणों में स्थान दे। जय श्री राम।

हमारे भाई, या यूँ कहें हमारे सबसे ज्यादा ख्याल रखने वाले भाई, वो सिर्फ परिवार नहीं थे - बल्कि वो हमारी खुशियों, गर्मजोशी और बिना शर्त साथ देने का एक स्थायी स्रोत थे। वो हर मौके पर, चाहे छोटा हो या बड़ा, अपनी प्यारी मुस्कान और सोच-समझ भरे स्वभाव के साथ हमेशा मौजूद रहते थे। वो उन छोटी-छोटी बातों का ख्याल रखते थे जो किसी भी पल को खास बना देती थी, और उनकी मौजूदगी ही हर मिलन को और भी खास बना देती थी। हमने उनके साथ अनगिनत खूबसूरत पल बिताए - त्यौहार, रोजमर्रा की बातचीतें, और मुश्किल समय में उनका शांत सहारा। उनकी मौजूदगी हमारे जीवन को रोशन कर देती थी, और उनके साथ बिताया हर एक पल हमेशा हमारे दिल में एक खास जगह बनाए रखेगा। और हम तो ये भी नहीं जानते कि किस तरह आपका आभार व्यक्त करें कि आपने हमें सालासर बालाजी के दर्शन का रास्ता दिखाया - यह हमारे लिए एक अनमोल उपहार था, जिसके लिए हम हमेशा आपके ऋणी रहेंगे। हमें सब कुछ बहुत याद आता है - हर मुस्कान, हर हाव-भाव, हर लम्हा। जहां कहीं भी आप हों, हम दुआ करते हैं कि आप खुश हों। आपको ढेर सारा प्यार भेजते हैं। हमें आपकी बहुत याद आएगी।

Tony Bhai was a gem of a person. embodying virtues that made him truly special. His unique approach to building relationships is unforgettable. Some of his remarkable qualities included: Meeting people with genuine interest and enthusiasm. His jadu ki jhappy that transmitted love, care and closeness in a single moment. Always bringing with him something to eat and sharing with others. Selflessly helping without expecting anything in return He was always the first person to remember and congratulate on important occasions like birthdays and anniversaries on phone and WhatsApp. Understanding emotions and empathy Never saying no to requests- he would always strive to make it possible. Extending a helping hand to family members in need with heart and soul. I believe he earned relations and respect in life, more than money. His dedication and willingness to help others is truly inspiring. May Tony Bhai's legacy live on, and may he rest in peace. May God provide him a place in His abode and grant peace to his loved ones.

"भरी महफ़िल में टूट गया एक सितारा. जो था हर दिल अज़ीज़ और सबको प्यारा।" -Sushma Khanna, Cousin Sister टोनी भैया हमारे परिवार के अनमोल रत्न थे। हर रिश्ते को सच्चाई से निभाने वाले, हर दिल को प्यारे, और सभी को स्नेह देने वाले। उनके साथ मेरी बहुत सी मीठी यादें जुड़ी हैं। टोनी भैया मुझे हमेशा 'बहन' कहकर बुलाते थे। मेरा जन्मदिन, शादी की सालगिरह, बच्चों के जन्मदिन, अर्थात् सभी महत्वपूर्ण दिन, वे कभी नहीं भूलते थे। वो सबसे पहले अपनी शुभकामनाएं देते थे और मोबाइल पर छोटी-छोटी वीडियो बनाकर भेजते थे। वह हमेशा सबकी मदद के लिए तैयार रहते थे।
मुझे याद है, 2012 में मेरी बेटी सरयू की शादी थी और उसे अशोक विहार पार्लर से नोएडा लाना था। परेशान थी कि इतनी दूर से कॉन लाएगा? टोनी भैया ने कहा, "बहन, तू चिंता न कर।” वह सही समय पर बेटी को ले आए और रास्ते में उसके सुखी जीवन के लिए मंदिर भी ले गए। ऐसे बहुत से छोटे-छोटे किस्से और बातें हैं, जिन्होंने हमारे मन में अमिट छाप छोड़ी है। दिवाली के त्यौहार पर वे सबसे पहले उपहार लेकर आते थे। उपहार देना उन्हें बहुत अच्छा लगता था। जब भी वह सालासर बालाजी जाते थे, मेरा प्रसाद कभी नहीं भूलते थे। मेरे लिए प्रसाद का डिब्बा ज़रूर आता था। वे भगवान को मानने वाले और ईश्वर के प्रति समर्पित व्यक्ति थे।प्रातः पूजा करना उनके जीवन का अभिन्न हिस्सा था। वे हर रिश्ते को गहराई और श्रद्धा से निभाते थे। मैं हस्पताल में उनसे मिलने 13 फरवरी को गई। बातों ही बातों में हंसी में मैंने उन्हें कहा कि, "पूनम भाभी और आप valentine's day मनाओं"। उनकी आँखें नम होगयी, कहने लगे कि 6 महीने से पूनम मेरी सेवा कर रही हैं; मैंने उसे परेशान कर दिया है। तो पूनम भाभी ने हंस कर जवाब दिया कि, "मुझे तो कोई परेशानी नहीं है, आप बस ठीक हो जाओ।" उन्होंने मुझे यह भी कहा कि दिव्या जैसी बेटी भगवान सबको दे।
भरी महफ़िल में टूट गया एक सितारा. जो था हर दिल अज़ीज़ और सबको प्यारा। Sushma Khanna. Cousin Sister वह बच्चों को बहुत स्नेह, प्यार व अपनापन देते थे, और बड़ों का आदर सम्मान करना उनकी आदत थी। उन्होंने अपने माता पिता की बहुत सेवा करी है। मैं उन्हें इस युग का श्रवण कुमार कहूंगी। हमारे टोनी भैया विनम्र, दयालु, ईमानदार, सहनशील और उदार हृदय थे। हमारे पूरे परिवार को जोड़कर रखने वाली एक कड़ी थे। मैं जब अंतिम बार उनसे मिली तो वह होश में नहीं थे लेकिन मुझे ऐसे लगा जैसे कह रहे हों "बहन रो नहीं, मैं लौट कर आऊंगा।" बहुत आसान है जमीन पर घर बना लेना दिल में जगह बनाने में zindagi गुजर जाती है।
उनके लिए दो लाइनेंः "रहें न रहें हम महका करेंगे बनके कली बनके सबा बाग ए वफ़ा में मेरा बेटा शिवम, 2024 में, शादी की सालगिरा पर कश्मीर गया था। तो उसको विश करने के लिए उसके मामू, टोनी भैया, का फोन आया और पूछा, "शिवम, तूने बुकिंग कराई हुई है क्या?” शिवम ने कहा, "नहीं मामू, बुकिंग तो कुछ नहीं है, बस ऐसे ही प्रोग्राम बना और जा रहा हूँ।" तो उन्होंने कहा कि "बस तू मेरे जानकार से मिल लेना," और उनका नंबर दे दिया। शिवम जैसे ही कश्मीर पहुँचा, एक बंदा उसको मिला। उन्होंने उनके लिए होटल बुक कर के रखा था। उन्होंने शिवम और सोनाक्षी को रात को खाना खिलाया और टोनी भैया की इतनी तारीफ की कि यह बात सुनकर शिवम भी बहुत खुश हुआ। शिवम और सोनाक्षी ने मामू का बहुत धन्यवाद किया। यह हमारे टोनी भैया की खासियत थी कि किसी को भी, किसी भी तरह से, किसी भी जगह पर अपनापन महसूस करा सकते थे।

(Page 50-51)
सुख दुख में साथ देने वाले भाई अनमोल होते हैं, मेरे लिए वो अनमोल भाई थे, टोनी भैया। मैं आज जो कुछ भी हूँ, भैया की सीख की वजह से हूँ। भैया ने हर कदम पे मेरा साथ दिया। जब भी किसी दिक्कत में होता, मेरे भैया मेरे साथ खड़े होते। मेरी खुशी में भैया मुझसे भी ज़्यादा खुश होते थे। भैया, आप हमेशा हमारे दिल में रहोगे। आपकी यादें, आपकी बातें, आपका सिखाया हुआ कितना कुछ, सब हमारे साथ रहेगा। आपके साथ बिताया हर पाल अनमोल था, और उन पलों को हमेशा अपने दिल में रखूँगा। We love you, bhaiya! Jai shree Ram!
भैया के साथ कुछ ऐसी यादें जो मैं भुलाये नहीं भूल सकता - जिस दिन उनका बड़ा बेटा आशीष पैदा हुआ था, मेरा मन बहुत कर रहा था के मैं भैया और भाभी से मिलूँ, बच्चे को देखने का बहुत मन था! तो मैं St Stephen's Hospital पहुँचा। पहुँचके पता चला के मिलने का समय ख़त्म हो चुका है। लेकिन मुझे ज़िदद् थी के मुझे तो देखना ही है बच्चो को ! गार्ड से बहुत रिक्वेस्ट कर ली पर उसने मुझे अंदर नहीं जाने दिया। मैंने क्या किया? दीवार फाँद के अंदर कूद गया और ढूँढते-ढूँढते आशीष वाले रूम में पहुँच गया। अंदर पहुँचके भैया ने पूछा, "तेरे पास तो पास नहीं था, तुझे अंदर किसने आने दिया?" मैंने भैया को बताया, "मुझे तो मिलना था तो मैं तो दीवार फाँद के आ. गया बस!" भैया बहुत ज़ोर से हंसे जितनी देर में मैं बच्चे से और भाभी से मिला, उतने में सारे के सारे guards और supervisor वगैरह सब आगये मुझे ढूँढते हुए बोले की कोई भाग के अंदर आया है! भैया ने मुझे बाथरूम में छुपा दिया और गार्ड्स को बोले, “जी यहाँ तो कोई नहीं आया?!" भैया ने उनको भगा दिया मैं तो काफ़ी डर गया था उस समय, बाद में एहसास हुआ के हाँ भाई, मैंने गलती की है। फिर भी मेरे बड़े भैया ने मुझे बचा लिया at St Stephen's Hospital, 1988
साल 1993 की बात है, मैं अपने दोस्तों के साथ करोल बाग में फ्रेंड्स कैफे में बैठे हुआ था। ऐसे ही गपशप मार रहे थे, और एक-दूसरे की टांग खींच रहे थे। इतने में किसी ने मेरे कंधे पर हाथ रखा। मैंने घूम कर देखा तो टोनी भैया थे। वो अपने किसी customer के साथ बिज़नेस मीटिंग के लिए आए हुए थे। मैंने अपने दोस्तों से उनको मिलवाया और हमारे साथ ही बैठने को बोला, पर वो बोले कि नहीं, तुम खेलो, और अलग टेबल पर अपने customer के साथ बैठ गए। बाद में जब हम खाना खा कर वेटर से बिल लाने को बोले, तो वो बोला कि आपको कुछ भी pay नहीं करना। हम बहुत हैरान हुए कि ऐसा क्यों? तो उसने बताया कि आपके भाई साहब, जो उस सीट पर बैठे थे, उन्होंने आपका भी बिल चुका दिया। मेरे friends को बड़ी हैरानी हुई कि, "भई, तेरा बिल तो ठीक है उन्होंने भर दिया, लेकिन हमारा बिल भी भर गए? कमाल है!" पर ऐसे ही थे हमारे टोनी भैया- दिलदार, सबको खिलाने- पिलाने वाले और पैसे की परवाह न करने वाले।
"A Legacy of Love and Loyalty" - Ravi Khattar, Brother
(Page 52)
There are so many things about him which can't be expressed in few words. He is the person who will always remain in our hearts... He was गुणों का भंडार। He was the bridge between the family and friends. I used to get his motivational messages everyday and if there was a gap of 2-3 days then लगता था कि सब ठीक है ना?? It's two months since he has left us even then it seems that he is around us. We bid him farewell even then it seems that when we go next time to India he will be there saying Ravi bhai मुझे बता क्या करना है.. In February 2024 on our trip to India, we stayed with Tony and Poonam... and in this year's we couldn't imagine that this will be our last meeting with him and that too in the hospital. We will be bidding farewell to him.. On 25th July 2024 it was Soumya's birthday.. and we called him. then Rishi asked. "Chachu we are in NZ for the last 20 years, when are you visiting us?" At that time he promised.. it will be next year and also shared the good news that he is going to become a granddad soon. Whenever we visited India he was always there to receive us and even after asking him not to bring anything, he would get so many things to eat.. to take it back home for everyone. He had a generous spirit and was kind to friends and family. He played a crucial role in keeping the family together. Tony left behind a legacy of love, loyalty and countless memories. He has been the best and outshined in every relationship he had.. as a son. husband. father. brother. uncle, grandfather.. This tribute conveys our deepest respect and affection for Tony. We all feel truly blessed to have known him and will carry his memories with us always. I miss you a lot Tony... When I go to study and see your picture I can't believe. But.... Tony. मेरे भाई, wherever you are. be happy and give your blessings to everyone.

(Page 53)
जबसे टोनी भैया के बारे में सोच रही हूँ, समझ नहीं आ रहा कि क्या बोलूँ और कहाँ से शुरू करूँ। मेरी ज़िंदगी में उनका आगमन करीब ५० साल पहले हुआ, जब में रवि की पन्नी बनकर आई। में रिश्ता औपचारिक था, फिर धीरे-धीरे देवर-भाभी और फिर भाई- बहन जैसा हो गया, क्योंकि मेरा मायका भी बत्रा परिवार से ही हैं, हम बेझिझक बातें करते थे। उन्हें खिलाने-पिलाने का बहुत शौक था... यदि कुछ ज़िक्र कर देते, अगली मुलाकात में वो चीज़ हमारे सामने होती। फरवरी 2024 में इंडिया आने पर हम एक हफ़्ता उनके पास रहे। मैं दिल्ली जाती तो कमला नगर की कचौड़ियाँ लाती थी, पर इस बार उन्होंने घर पर ही बनवा दी थीं, दूसरों को खुशी देना उनकी फितरत में था। 20-21 साल पहले New Zealand migrate होने के बाद हमारा रिश्ता और गहरा हो गया। वे परिवार के लिए जैसे एक पुल थे, कोई भी ख़ुशी या दुख, सबसे पहले उनसे जुड़ता। रवि, पिंकी और टोनी भैया- तीनों का आपस में गहरा प्यार था। हमारी बेटी की शादी में उन्होंने मेलबर्न आना था, पर डेंडी जी को अकेला नहीं छोड़ सके, इसलिए बल्ली भैया आए। उन्हें सबके जन्मदिन और शादी की सालगिरहें याद रहतीं, जैसे ही महीना शुरू होता, शुभकामनाएं भेजना शुरू कर देते। हम इंडिया से साढ़े छह-सात घंटे आगे हैं, न्यूज़ीलैंड में रात 12 बजे होते ही उनकी कॉल आती। इस बार हमारे पोते का पहला बर्थडे 21 मार्च को था, ऋचा-मिक्की कहते हैं कि जैसे ही 12 बजे, सबसे पहले टोनी चाचू की कॉल मिस हो गई... बहुत याद आए। हमारी नाती मायरा, साढ़े पाँच साल की, उनसे सिर्फ एक बार मिली मगर 'टोनी चाचू कहकर पुकारती है। कुछ ही दिन पहले, रात को जब भगवान को प्रणाम करने गई तो मायरा भी साथ थी, मैंने उससे पूछा की क्या मांगा भगवान से, कहती हैं के उसने भगवान से टोनी चाचू के ठीक होने की प्रार्थना की... उसे नहीं पता कि वे अब नहीं रहे। टोनी भैया अब हमारे बीच नहीं हैं, लेकिन हमेशा दिलों में रहेंगे। यादें अनगिनत हैं... टोनी भैया, जहाँ भी हों, खुश रहिए, अपना प्यार यूं ही बरसाते रहिए। जय श्री राम।
"His Presence Had a Way of Bringing Light Into the Space" - Rashmi Verma, Cousin Sister
(Page 54)
Tony Bhaiya was always the first person available for everyone. He was the go-to person... never said no... never hesitated. That was just how he was... any day, any time, anywhere. Even though we didn't meet very often. whenever we did. it was pure joy and happiness. Our relationship was always warm. There was never a time when it felt distant or cold. I have lived outside India most of the time, and there were times when I couldn't be there for my parents. In those times. Tony Bhaiya was always there. His presence filled the gap. He never let it feel like something or someone was missing. Over the years he evolved into a very mature, caring dedicated and kind human being. What never changed, though. was his core nature... his positivity. His presence had a way of bringing light into the space... you just felt better around him. To me, family was his biggest strength. I can't say much about his weaknesses... they weren't something that came to the forefront. What stands out, even now. is his unconditional love and the respect he gave everyone. This is something I hope people always remember about him.
"My Go-to Person" - Sanjeev Mutreja (Bobby), Cousin Brother
(Page 55)
I have always known Tony Bhaiya as a 'go-to' person in the family. Whenever I used to find myself in crisis and there was any medical emergency with my parents, like they had to be admitted to hospital. a major comforting thought was that as soon as Tony Bhaiya would come to know of it. he would be there by my side. That used to happen invariably and it was a big comfort. I remember vividly that my father got a heart attack in 2003 at 1:30 a.m. Tony Bhaiya got to know about it in the morning and rushed immediately to the hospital. For two weeks. Papa was in hospital. and Tony Bhaiya was always there. When Papa was discharged from the hospital. Tony Bhaiya was there with his car to bring back Papa from hospital to home. Such was his dedication. His business used to bring him to Janakpuri often. and whenever he came to West Delhi, he used to drop in to our house, which was quite often. And whenever he came, he never came empty-handed. he always came with lots of fruits dry fruits. and snacks. I and my parents even looked forward to his charming presence and lively visits. Hard to believe that he is not there. We were supposed to go together to Haridwar on 2nd October but he fell ill. Then he had to visit our rented house and also oversee the construction of our new house being constructed. but alas, it was not to be. May God bless him wherever he is.
TONY CHACHA - RK Arora, Friend, Father-in-law of Niece Garima
(Page 56)
Although younger to me yet lovingly I called him Tony Chacha. Right from the very first day found him always welcoming. cheerful, a generous host. a fully devoted Hanuman Bhakt. He always met with genuine interest and enthusiasm. He always remembered. and was always first to congratulate on important occasions. Whenever we met, we had "Pyaar ki Jaffi" full of warmth of togetherness. Always found him full of life, optimistic, selfless. full of compassion and unconditional love. He was the darling of kids who always remembered him for a variety of gifts which he never missed to give. Tony Chacha - your love & affection has been etched that deep in north west corner of my heart that you are always in my thoughts and prayers, even to the extent that when I offer water to Sun God and I offer tarpan to my ancestors. the same is offered to you as well as to Garima's Mom on daily basis. I earnestly pray may Shree Vishnu Ji provide your pious & noble soul a place in His abode. CM Shanti

Tony (Batra Ji) was one of those rare souls who could instantly connect with anyone he met. You couldn't help but become his fan forever. He was always so lively. vibrant in his conversations, and full of warmth and affection in his social life. Our group of senior citizens shared many wonderful moments together-watching handpicked movies, followed by grand dinners filled with laughter and late-night conversations. One of the most unforgettable memories for me and my family was the New Year's night on 31st December 2023. which we spent with him and our families. His hospitality was unmatched. and his singing, especially with karaoke, made that night truly magical. Tony, you will always remain with each of us. In the melodies. the smiles, and in our hearts, forever. "Tum jaise log kabhi door nahi hote, bas nazar se ojhal hote hain."

टोनी जी बहुत ही सुलझे हुए, हंसमुख, सबको खुशियाँ देने वाले इंसान थे। पहली बार ही जब हम उनसे मिले तो लगा जैसे हम उन्हें बहुत पहले से जानते हैं। इतने मिलनसार, हंसमुख और सबके साथ घुल-मिलकर रहने वाले थे। किसी का भी जन्मदिन हो या सालगिरह - एक सुंदर-सी फोटो के साथ सबसे पहले वही बधाई देते। खाने के लिए मनुहार करके खिलाना, और कोई भी चीज़ अच्छी है बोलते ही वो कब मंगा देते, पता ही नहीं चलता। मंगलवार को सुंदरकांड का पाठ, उनके साथ शिरडी जाना, वो पल भी यादगार हैं। जब भी वो हमारे साथ होते, हर पल में उनकी अनमोल यादें जुड़ी होतीं। वो दूसरों के बारे में बहुत सोचते थे। जब बीमार थे, तब भी इतनी तकलीफ में भी इतनी हिम्मत थी उनमें कि अपने दुख में भी अस्पताल के कर्मचारियों को कुछ न कुछ बाँट रहे थे और सबका हालचाल पूछते रहते थे। हमें उनके साथ ज़्यादा रहने का मौका नहीं मिला, सिर्फ तीन साल ही उनका साथ मिला। लेकिन दुनिया में अगर में से दस आदमी पुण्यात्मा होंगे, तो उनमें से एक बत्रा जी ज़रूर होंगे। टोनी बत्रा जी हमारे जीवन में एक महत्वपूर्ण स्थान रखते थे। विश्वास ही नहीं होता कि अब वो हमारे बीच नहीं हैं। उनकी बातें, उनकी यादें हमें हमेशा याद रहेंगी। उनकी अच्छाई, सहानुभूति और अपनापन कभी भी भुलाया नहीं जा सकता। हम उनकी कमी महसूस करेंगे, लेकिन उनकी यादों को सहेजकर रखेंगे। बत्रा जी को सादर नमन। ॐ शांति

Two months have passed, but the pain of your absence remains as fresh as ever. You were not just my brother, you were my strength, my protector, my friend. A soul so kind, generous, and full of love- you truly embodied what it means to be human.. There are so many beautiful memories of you, moments of laughter, support, and quiet understanding that words can never fully capture. You were a blessing in our lives and your absence is a void we feel deeply. You stood by me like a pillar through every sorrow, especially when I lost my husband, and celebrated every joy with me, as if it were your own. Your comforting words, warm presence and unwavering support are etched in my heart forever. You lived not just for yourself but for others- always reaching out, always ready to help, always spreading light wherever you went. The world feels a little colder without your smile, but your spirit lives on in every life you touched. May your noble soul rest in eternal peace. You will be forever missed.

जय श्रीराम भैया, मेरी शादी से पहले मेरा कोई बड़ा भाई नहीं था, और शादी होते ही जैसे मुझे आप में एक सच्चा बड़ा भाई मिल गया। आपने मेरे बड़े भाई की कमी पूरी कर दी। आपसे मुझे हमेशा इतना स्नेह और समर्थन मिला है कि मैं पूरे दिल से कह सकती हूँ- मेरी शादी से लेकर अक्षय की शादी तक, जितना साथ आपने दिया, उतना किसी और ने नहीं दिया। यहाँ तक कि जब हमें सपोर्ट की ज़रूरत नहीं भी थी, तब भी आप हमेशा हमारे साथ खड़े रहे। आपने हम सबको, खासकर पूरे परिवार को, जितनी सकारात्मकता दी है, वह अमूल्य है। विशेषकर कोविड के समय, जब आपने ज़ूम कॉल पर सुंदरकांड का पाठ शुरू किया, तो पूरे परिवार को एक सूत्र में बाँध कर रखा। वह एक बेहद खूबसूरत और सशक्त पहल थी, जिसने मुश्किल समय में हम सबको जोड़े रखा। भजन गाने की प्रेरणा भी मुझे आपसे ही मिली। उससे पहले तो मैंने कभी भजन गाने की हिम्मत नहीं की थी, लेकिन आपकी वजह से वह भी सम्भव हो पाया। आपके स्नेह और प्रेरणा ने मुझे कई स्तरों पर निखारा है। आप हमारे परिवार के उस धागे की तरह हैं जिसमें हम सब मोतियों की तरह पिरोए हुए हैं। वो सूत्र जो सबको जोड़ कर रखता है- वही आप हैं, भैया। हमें हमेशा ऐसे ही जोड़ कर रखने की प्रेरणा देते रहिए। थैंक यू सो मच फॉर एवरीथिंग, भैया। जैसे रहे हैं, वैसे ही हमेशा हमारे साथ बने रहिए।
Mere Pyare Tony Bhai! - आपका भिंडी, आपका भाई पिंकी
(Page 65)
मेरे प्यारे टोनी भाई ! आप क्या चले गए, इस ज़िंदगी से रौनक ही चली गई। मुझे तो यह समझ में नहीं आ रहा कि मैं आपको किस रूप में याद करें- अपने भाई के रूप में, एक दोस्त के रूप में, एक राज़दार के रूप में, एक पितृभक्त के रूप में, या एक फैमिली मैन के रूप में। बच्चों को अच्छी शिक्षा देने वाले, उन्हें तरक्की की राह पर ले जाने वाले इंसान के रूप में याद करूं, या उस इंसान के रूप में, जो अपनी पत्नी को हर समय इतना प्यार करता था। या फिर उस रूप में, जिसने पूरे परिवार को एक तरह से बांधकर रखा था। जितनी बार मैं सोचता हूँ, उतनी बार एक नया रूप सामने आता है। लेकिन सबसे ऊपर अगर मैं आपको मानता हूँ, तो एक परम भक्त के रूप में। यह बात पहले भी बोल चुका हूँ। आज सुबह एक अज़ीज़ से बातचीत हो रही थी, वो मेरा भी बहुत अज़ीज़ है और आपका भी। उसने मुझे एक तस्वीर भेजी। हम तीनों एक साथ सालासर गए थे। वो देखकर मैंने उसे यही जवाब दियाः "यह तस्वीर तो बहुत ही छोटी सी चीज़ है। टोनी भाई तो दिल में इस तरह बसे हैं कि उनकी याद आते ही उनकी तस्वीर सामने आ जाती है। और जैसे ही तस्वीर आती है, दो आंसू भी बह जाते हैं।" ना जाने वो आंसू कब रुकेंगे। पर में रोज़ खुद को एक रिज़ॉल्व, एक चीज़ समझाने की कोशिश करता हूँ, जैसी जबरदस्त और पूर्णता वाली ज़िंदगी आपने जी है- अपने मित्रों, बड़ों, परिवार, बिज़नेस एसोसिएट्स, बच्चों और बच्चों के बच्चों के लिए वो ज़िंदगी सेलिब्रेट की जानी चाहिए। "We need to celebrate your life - every day in and every day out. Because only if we celebrate your life, you will be happy wherever you are." यह हमारे लिए, खासकर मेरे लिए, बहुत मुश्किल होगा। क्योंकि हम जन्म से साथ थे। हमने अपना इतना टाइम साथ निकाला है, इतनी शरारतें की हैं। चलो, अब एक teens की naughty बात भी याद आ गई- बचपन में एक लड़की थी, जिस पर हम तीनों का क्रश था। पर उसका क्रश मेरे पर था। जैसे ही दोनों भाइयों को पता चला, वो मायूस हो गए। और जैसे ही मुझे पता चला कि दोनों का दिल टूट गया है, मैंने उस क्रश को छोड़ दिया। अब इससे ज़्यादा कुछ इस बारे में कहना नहीं चाहता, क्योंकि बच्चे और बच्चों के बच्चे भी पढ़ेंगे, तो बड़ा अजीब लगेगा। तो मेरे भाईजान, जहां भी हो, जैसे भी हो- अपनी मुस्कान, अपना आशीर्वाद हम पर बनाए रखना, बरसाते रहना। जय श्री राम, जय श्री हनुमान, जय बजरंग बली की जय। आपका भिंडी, आपका भाई पिंकी

The Adventures of Petha and Mufali - K. K. Aggarwal, a.k.a. Bittoo
(Page 71)
In 1970s, while preparing for my 12th Board exams- during two months of study leave, I stayed at JK Bhaiya's home in Titarpur. That's where I met Tony, and we became close friends. Being January winters and my sweet tooth, he started calling me PETHA. He loved peanuts, so I called him MUFALI. MUFALI was emotional and kindhearted. He'd see me studying from morning to night. locked in a room. In the evening, he'd often request (or beg) Bhaiya to let me take a break. Really, it was for both of us, to unwind and occasionally birdwatch in Rajouri Garden! Pinky sometimes joined us on these fun little outings. I think he was working at Godrej back then. MUFALI also had a great appetite and loved street food. Being with him. I became a foodie too. Those were beautiful days, etched in my soul. They say you can take away wealth and property, but not memories. TONY was not only emotional and kindhearted but also an HONEST and GOD-fearing Ram Bhagat. I was reminded of him just last week when I went to drop a friend at New Delhi Railway Station - Ajmeri Gate side. It brought back a memory of an incident from there that still gives me goosebumps. Tony was once crossing the flyover from Paharganj to Ajmeri Gate. At the end of the flyover, he saw a crowd around an old man sitting on the pavement. After passing the crowd, he noticed a red cloth on the road. He stopped his blue Vespa scooter, picked up the cloth. and opened it, it was a gold bar. He understood what had happened. He quietly put it in his pocket and approached the old man to inquire. The man said. "Bas samjho meri zindagi ki kamai kho gayi. Ab mere paas marne ke alawa koi raasta nahi hai." And just like that, our Ram Bhagat, our honest and pure soul gave the man his assets back. He asked for nothing in return except blessings, which meant far more to him than money ever could. Think about it. Close your eyes. Would we be able to let go of something worth 10 lakh rupees in today's world. especially while still struggling in life? I say this as an advocate who deals with money matters daily where money is often valued more than relationships and honesty.. GREAT TONY, WE ARE PROUD OF YOU. TONY, I CAN FEEL YOU SMILING BESIDE ME. YOU WILL BE IN OUR HEARTS FOREVER
A Bond Beyond Blood - A Tribute to G K Batra (Tony Bhaiya) - By someone who knew him like a brother since 1980, Arvind Mittal
(Page 72-73)
Today. I speak from the depths of my heart about a man who was more than just a part of my life, he shaped it in many ways. GK Batra. whom we lovingly called Tony Bhaiya, wasn't just my elder brother in spirit. he was also my closest friend. my trusted advisor. and my emotional anchor since the year 1980. It is rare to find someone who becomes an integral part of your family and your soul. not because of shared blood. but because of shared love. mutual respect. and unwavering presence. From the very beginning of our association. Tony Bhaiya radiated something special. He lived with a grace that made him stand out, yet remained grounded with humility that made him so loved. In every interaction, in every gesture, there was sincerity, kindness, and a rare sense of presence. He wasn't just there he truly cared. His qualities weren't performative they were his essence. For him. love, regard. and respect weren't social expectations they were his way of life.
A Gentleman Among Us Tony Bhaiya was the epitome of a thorough gentleman, not in a superficial or formal sense, but in the truest, most heartfelt way. He treated every person he came across with dignity. whether it was family, friends. or acquaintances. His aura commanded warmth and his smile disarmed even the most distant hearts. He had a unique gift: he made everyone feel important. If you were speaking with him, he gave you his complete attention. If you were celebrating something he celebrated with you as if it were his own joy. If you were in trouble, he was your calm during the storm. He had an uncanny ability to listen, not just to words. but to the unsaid. No problem was ever too small for him. No person ever too distant. He was a solution to many problems and a source of strength for many souls. The Memory Keeper of Our Lives One of Tony Bhaiya's most extraordinary and touching qualities was his astonishing memory, not just of facts or events, but of people's moments. He remembered everyone's birthdays and wedding anniversaries, not just for one age group or a handful of people. but across generations and extended families. He made sure to call. message, or personally remind others of those dates. In a world where many forget even their own commitments. Tony Bhaiya was the one who remembered us. He remembered what mattered to us. His calendar wasn't marked by holidays, it was filled with hearts. And he celebrated these occasions not as formalities, but with genuine emotion. He kept alive the ties between people. reminding us that relationships matter, that every person matters. A Presence That Can Never Fade To speak of Tony Bhaiya is to write a story that has no end. We could talk about him for hours. share stories for days. and even write a book, and still. it wouldn't be enough. His life was so full. so rich in meaning, that even the pages of a book might fall short in capturing his spirit. He had a spiritual grace, something beyond the tangible. that made him feel almost divine in moments. Whether it was the way he connected people, calmed situations. remembered details, or just \*showed up when it mattered most. his actions were simple, yet sacred. He was. in many ways, a holy soul a person who made others believe in goodness again. And now. though he is no longer with us in form, his presence is everywhere. In our memories. In our celebrations. In our moments of missing him. His absence is profound. but so is the legacy he leaves behind. Tony Bhaiya, this tribute may be written in words, but it's etched in the silence of our hearts too. You were loved beyond measure. You are missed beyond words. Your life made our lives better, fuller, kinder. And even though we grieve today, we do so with the deepest gratitude that we had the honor of knowing you, walking beside you, and calling you our own. You have left behind more than memories - you have left behind a way of being that will guide us forever. Thank you for the love, the laughter, the lessons, and the light. Love you, Bhaiya. Missing you! May God bless your divine soul and keep you in eternal peace.
A Bridge of Hearts - A Tribute to Shri Gajender Kumar Batra (Tony ji) - By Shaikh Bashir Ahmed
(Page 74-75)
It's hard to believe he is no longer among us. Batra ji was not just a friend: he was like a brother. family in every sense of the word. In a world so often divided by religion and background, he was a living bridge of love, unity. and understanding. I follow Islam, and he was a Hindu, yet we never saw differences. Instead. we found common ground in humanity, kindness, and mutual respect. In our faith, we call such a person a farishta (an angel) and that is exactly what he was. His humility, generosity, and boundless warmth lit up the lives of everyone he met. He had a rare gift: to make others feel seen. welcomed. and loved. I remember when I visited Delhi with my family, he welcomed us into his home as if we were his own kin. That day wasn't just a visit. it was a blessing, filled with heartfelt conversation. laughter, and the warmth only someone like Batra ji could provide. One of my most cherished memories is from 2008. when Batra ji visited Kashmir for the Amarnath Yatra. Despite the crowds and chaos. he came straight from Srinagar Airport to our home with his friends. We shared meals. stories, and unforgettable moments. Due to heavy traffic. we decided to take a helicopter for the yatra. Upon returning, we hosted a traditional Kashmiri lunch with a dastarkhan, copper utensils, and kehwa tea. He was fascinated by our culture, comparing it to Iran. and expressed heartfelt joy at the experience. When he returned from the pilgrimage, he brought back prasad for us, saying he had prayed for my family. Years later. in 2017. when we visited Delhi again, he insisted on picking us up himself- no cab no taxi. He spent the entire day with us even putting aside his business. We met his lovely family his wife, daughter. and father. During that trip. his love and care reminded us once again of how special he was. I still recall attending his son's wedding. another joyful memory. filled with warmth and celebration. Batra ji loved my children. Sheikh Waseem and Sheikh Imran. and often spoke to them over the phone. That bond extended across generations. In his final days. when I learned from a friend that he had been hospitalised. I quickly called him. Though his voice was faint, he still had that same kindness. He connected me to a Kashmiri woman in his ward. among other things she told us how fondly he spoke of us. Even in illness his thoughts were with others, with us. When I received a message from his phone. His family is working on a biography to preserve his legacy. That message brought both sorrow and joy; sorrow that he is no longer with us, but joy in knowing that his incredible life will be remembered and honored. Describing Batra ji in words is nearly impossible. He was joyful, full of life, compassionate, and utterly irreplaceable. His spirit lives on in every person he touched, every memory he created, and every prayer we say for him. I pray that his children inherit his grace and goodness, and that his soul finds eternal peace. Batra ji may no longer walk beside us, but he will forever live in our hearts. You will always be missed, Tony ii. But more than that you will always be remembered. With deepest sorrow, undying respect, and brotherly love, Your grieving brother and friend Sheikh Bashir Ahmad

"मेरे भइया मेरे सर जी / मेरे पथ प्रदर्शक। मेरी फैमिली का ध्यान रखने वाले। जितना सोचें उतना कम है। ऐसा इंसान इस कलयुग में मिलना नामुमकिन था। हमारी vibration (dil ka connection) इतनी strong थी; अनेकों बार हम दोनों सोचते थे और कुछ ही पलों के बाद हम आमने-सामने होते थे। यह आपस में एक-दूसरे के प्रति लगाव ही था। वो हर पल मेरी यादों में रहते हैं। परमात्मा से प्रार्थना है कि ये यादें हमेशा बनी रहें।"

Remembering him reminds me of all the fond memories with him. He has been a support system to all my family members specially my papa. Still cannot believe that he is no more between us. This year's trip to Delhi (mummy's house) was incomplete without him. He used to come to meet us everytime and with lots of goodies for our kids. Our childhood is incomplete without mentioning him. He used to come with hands full of gifts and sweets on our birthdays and with that sweet smile of his. That warm hug. those life lessons on our low days, always available for us in all situations. His tuesday fasts, and coincidentally it used to be tuesday whenever he used to visit our house. We wonder how he used to remember everyone's birthdays and anniversary. How he used to wish us first in the morning every year. He used to send pic collage on our kids birthday. On every family party/ function he used to make sure that everyone has pictures with each other. Uncle, we miss you a lot. Papa has lost his most dearest friend. Mummy has lost her brother. Even our kids miss their Batra nanu. Pihu n Samarth keep asking us about you. Please rest in peace. You have struggled a lot in your entire life. You will always be there in our hearts. Lots of love to you always, Megha and Dipti

(Page 78)
Tony was not just my true friend. philosopher & guide, he was a beacon of kindness, selflessness, and unwavering faith. He possessed a rare and beautiful simplicity that made everyone feel valued and respected. Tony's unwavering commitment to helping those around him was a testament to the depth of his character. Tony was an excellent son. a dedicated husband and father, an exceptional brother. and a very loving grandfather. His unwavering love and dedication to his family were truly inspiring, and he was a source of strength and support for all of us. Tony's faith and reverence for life were qualities that inspired everyone fortunate enough to know him. He approached every moment with humility and grace, always ready to lend a hand or offer a kind word. His dedication to respecting the dignity of every life he encountered left an indelible mark on all of us. As we remember Tony. we hold on to the countless memories of his gentle smile his generous spirit. and his steadfast faith. He has touched our lives in ways that words cannot fully capture. Though he is no longer with us, his legacy of compassion and love will forever remain in our hearts.
"If You Have Two Friends in Your Lifetime, You're Lucky" - M. R. Raman, Friend
(Page 79)
Let me proudly say I had only one VERY GOOD FRIEND and I am ever grateful to God for that.... First and foremost. I never treated him as a "business partner". but always as a younger brother or should I say a trusted friend. as brothers keep fighting but not a true friend.... For anything and everything if there was a person whom one can trust. believe, have confidence, enjoy the company at any point of time, to me, it was no one else but TONY. I have many incidents to quote here. Sharing a few In Godrej we used to have monthly sales meetings at various locations viz.. Lucknow. Jaipur. Chandigarh etc.. Me and Raj Kumar Shahaney used to be very busy in the first ten days of every month. Tony also used to tell us that he is also going to attend the MRM (monthly review meeting) every month by visiting his favorite temple in Rajasthan (not able to immediately recollect the name) with his close friends from the business group. Never did he forget to bring Prasad for me and my family. If he was around Connaught Place around 6 pm. he would give me a call and say that he is going home via Asaf Ali Road and can pick me up. Not only that he will ensure he drops me back at Rohini and spends some time with my family members, enjoying a south indian coffee. At least once in ten days he used to register his attendance and eat whatever was available in the house. He really cherished south indian light delicacies like Idly. Upma etc.. Not even once we missed him in any of our house functions, get togethers, as to me he was part of my family. Even if he had a very busy schedule, he would drop in for a few minutes. He attended my son Deepak's marriage but could not do so for my daughter Divya. He ensured his son to make it a point visit our house in far off Chennai to meet us and greet her with a nice Gift. When after spending over 50 years in Delhi and over 25 years in the association of my dearest friend Tony, when I bid farewell to Delhi and shifted to Bangalore. he came to Nizamuddin station to see us off as usual bringing all the best items available in various parts of the city. For my daughter's marriage he could not make it to Chennai but made one condition that he will print the invitation cards from his side. The card he selected was so good that even now in many of my relatives house it is being preserved. In spite of my utmost pressure, he just took Re 1 for the card printing. Every now and then he used to phone me up to help a friend/known person who needs help/support in Bangalore. I always used to respond to such requests without wasting a moment as Tony's friend is my friend to....... Last but not the least, though we had a very cordial relation, he never misused the friendship for any favours. undue support etc.. in business deals. Such a great personality, a great friend and full of energy and always ready to give a helping hand. one can see it in movies. I had the privilege of his association for a very long time. Tony will be remembered for ever by me and my family members
"Aapke Yahan Par AC Lagwa Dein?" - Dr Rishi Pal Singh, Friend, Neighbour, Chai Partner
(Page 80)
बत्रा साहब को भुलाना तो मेरे ख्याल से नामुमकिन है। मेरी जो उनसे मुलाकात हुई थी, वह बहुत पुरानी है। 1989 में मुलाक़ात एक confrontation के साथ हुई थी। मैं बत्रा साहब के बिल्कुल पीछे रहता हूँ। मेरे कमरे की खिड़की, बत्रा साहब के कमरे की खिड़की के बिल्कुल सामने थी। तो बत्रा साहब ने उस खिड़की में AC लगवा लिया और उसकी गर्म हवा मेरे कमरे में जाती थी। थोड़े दिनों तक तो मैं चुप रहा, फिर एक दिन मेरी मिसेज़ ने कहा कि आप उनसे रिक्वेस्ट करो, क्या पता कुछ हल निकल जाए। मैंने कहा कि सीधा तो बात नहीं करूँगा, लेकिन मैं थूसू जी से बात कर सकता हूँ। थूसू जी, बत्रा जी के सामने रहते थे और आपस में काफ़ी मिलते-जुलते रहते थे। तो एक दिन मैं थूसू जी के पास गया और उनको अपनी समस्या बताई, तो उन्होंने कहा कि क्या AC टोनी ने लगवाया है? तो मैंने कहा कि बत्रा साहब ने, क्योंकि मुझे नहीं पता था कि उनका नाम टोनी है। हम दोनों उनके पास गए और भूसू जी ने घंटी बजाई। तो बत्रा जी निकल कर आए। थूसू जी ने कहा कि ये डॉक्टर साहब हैं और इनकी एक समस्या है। तो बोले, "आओ जी, क्या हुआ?" मैंने कहा कि आपके AC की गर्म हवा मेरे कमरे में जाती है और हमारा तो एक कमरा बेकार हो गया। तो वो एकदम से बोले, "एक AC आपके भी लगवा देता हूँ।" मैंने कहा, "मेरे को नहीं चाहिए। और पीछे धोबी भी है।" तो बोले, "सोच कर कुछ समाधान निकालते हैं।" दो दिन बाद बोले, "सर जी, यदि AC की डायरेक्शन बदल दूँ तो कैसा रहेगा?" मैंने कहा, "ठीक रहेगा।" और उन्होंने दूसरी खिड़की में लगवा लिया। उसके बाद वो मेरे दिल में बस गए और हम एक-दूसरे के बहुत करीब आ गए। एक इंसिडेंट और याद आ रही है जब मैंने उनसे कहा कि मुझे प्रिस्क्रिप्शन प्रिंट कराने हैं। तो बोले, "मैं जान-पहचान वालों का काम नहीं करता, क्योंकि उनसे पैसे मांगने में शर्म आती है।" तो मैंने कहा, "मैं तो एडवांस में पेमेंट करता हूँ।" तो बोले, "सैंपल दे देना, काम हो जाएगा।" और मैंने सैंपल दिया, तो प्रिंट करके ला दिए। पेमेंट के लिए बोलते थे, "कोई बात नहीं, ले लेंगे।" पर मैं उनको पेमेंट साथ के साथ कर देता था। अभी भी मेरे पास पेपर का इतना स्टॉक है कि जब तक क्लीनिक होगा, पेपर नहीं खरीदना पड़ेगा। अब तो हम एक-दूसरे को भाई समझते थे। मेरे लिए तो वो अभी भी मेरे दिल में हैं। शायद ज़िंदगी भर भुलाना मुश्किल है।
"Sarvagun Sampann Mahamanav" - Shree Shankar Swami, Guru, Mitra
(Page 81)
आदरणीय टोनी जी का जीवन एक महाकाव्य है। उनके जीवन काव्य की सुगंध वर्षों वर्ष आत्मीय जनों के हृदयों को महकाती रहेगी। दिवंगत टोनी जी हमारे आदर्श रहे हैं। भूतो न भविष्यति ना तो ऐसा सर्वगुण संपन्न महामानव कभी हमारे जीवन में आया और ना ही कोई संभावना है। वह एक और अकेले हैं जिन्होंने हर किसी के हृदय को जीता। जन जन के प्रति उनका कामना रहित निस्वार्थ प्रेम, हर रिश्ते में समर्पण और सहयोग, उनका परोपकारी और उदार हृदय, वंदनीय है। निश्चय ही वे परम पद के अधिकारी हैं। उनके जीवन काव्य का वर्णन करना मेरे लिए बड़ा ही दुष्कर और असहज है। कलम नहीं चलती, वाणी वर्णन नहीं कर पाती। उनके महात्म्य को समझने समझाने के लिए शब्द नहीं मिल रहे, निशब्द हूँ मैं, पर भावनाओं में उनके लिए शाश्वत प्रेम भरा है। जब कभी टोनी जी की मधुर पावन स्मृतियों को भुला पाता हूँ तो परमात्मा की याद आती है। और परमात्मा के सानिध्य में जब टोनी जी को देखता हूँ तो मन शांति पाने लगता है कि हे दिवंगत आत्मने, आप को हमारा शत शत प्रणाम प्रणाम प्रणाम।

टोनी भाई कभी-कभी चेहरा देखकर हाव-भाव समझ लेते थे। क्या बात, परेशान हैं? बिना बोले दिल की बातों को समझ लेना आता था भाई को। मेरे दोनों बेटे बहुत बार किसी भी सलाह के लिए भाई को बिना झिझक फोन कर लेते थे। भाई मेरे ऑफिस के आसपास से निकलते हुए फोन कर लेते थे ...कहाँ है? झप्पी मार के निकलना है। कहीं से निकलते समय फोन करते थे - समोसे खाएगा? यह खाएगा, वो खाएगा। जब ऑफिस आते थे, गाड़ी में बहुत सामान रखते थे - प्रसाद खाएगा... ले, फ्रूट्स रखे हैं... खाएगा? मंगल और शनि को बजे पाठ करना है। किसी का फोन नहीं उठाते थे पाठ के बीच में। मैं गलती से फोन कर लेता था तो बाद में कॉल ज़रूर आता था। Lots and lots of memories since always and for ever

और लोग कहते हैं कि तुम्हारे बारे में कुछ लिखे तुम्हारे प्यार, स्नेह, और अपनेपन को शब्दों में लिखना, बहुत कठिन ही नहीं, बहुत मुश्किल है। तुम्हारी वह जादू की झप्पी, जिसको भी एक बार मिल जाती थी, वह zindagi भर तुम्हारा हो के रह जाता था। मुझे तो लगता है कि ऊपर वाले को भी तुम्हारी झप्पी की जरुरत थी। जहाँ भी रहो दोस्त परिवार, दोस्तों और सभी स्नेहजनों को ऊपर से ऐसा ही प्यार और स्नेह देते रहना जैसे कि यहां देते रहे हो । काश फिर मिलने की वजह मिल जाये, साथ जितना भी बिताया वो पल वापिस मिल जाएँ, चलो अपनी आँखें बंद कर लें, क्या पता ख्वाबों में गुजरा हुआ पल मिल जाये.. परमपिता परमात्मा के श्री चरणों में सादर नमन तुम्हारा मित्र अरुण
Yaadein - Alka Singh, Principal, Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute
(Page 87)
I remember meeting Mr Tony in the corridors of AFGJI when JK Batra Sir was the Vice-Principal. I gently referred to him as 'Tony Sir' and Batra Sir in his loud baritone said-Don't call him Tony Sir. just call him Tony. But I also referred to him as Mr Tony or Tony Sir as he was elder to me. It is hard to believe that he is not with us. I still think that one day he will get down from his car in front of AFGJI and hand me a packet of papers to go through and edit. The other day my nephew reminded me and said that Batra Sir has never come to our house, but Tony Sir came to our house once. It was summer vacation and the school magazine 'Swarnima' had to be edited and printed. So he came to our home in Mahavir Enclave all the way from Shalimar Bagh to hand me the packet of papers. His dedication and commitment to his work is what I will always remember. He would often come to school with Question papers banners magazines etc. Our school has really had a long association with him and the entire family. He would generally come around 2 pm. meet the staff members with a lot of positivity and warmth. His conversations with me would centre around Batra Sir. all the children in his family etc. Once I was required to go to his office for some editing work. Out of concern he said. 'Ma'am, it is not a good area for you to come.' But I said. ' The area is not important, we have to complete the work'. So I boarded the metro and e- rickshaw and went. I sat. did the work and came back'. Nothing was inconvenient with him being around. For all of us, he will always be remembered as the smiling, frank religious, cheerful Tony Sir. It is difficult to think about him in the past tense. Farewell Tony Sir. till we meet on the other side.
"Ho Jayega Yaar!" - Brijesh, The Air Force School
(Page 88)
Call him a contractor or a friend or an elder brother or a mentor. or use words that cannot describe our bond, this is my journey with Tony ji. I joined AFBBS in 1992. I met him first at Air Force Bal Bharti School... a cheerfully smiling personality who always used to say, "Ho jayega yaar." whenever any difficulty arose. The best of the best at Bal Bharti School introduced him to me as Tony ji. In 1993. I joined TAFS. there I saw again, the same lovely contractor. He told me that he was dealing with all three AF schools. Till 2010. I knew him only as Tony ji- the contractor for printing and stationery who was printing all our jobs with utmost sincerity and maintained full confidentiality while printing question papers. One day. I got a call from the security officer that Mr. Gajender Batra would like to visit the school. and I thought, who is this fellow? When he reached the school. I got to know that Tony's actual name is Mr. Gajender Batra - and the second shock was that he is the brother of the AFGJI principal. At that moment, my respect for him rose to even greater heights- for being someone who, despite being the real brother of the principal of the same organisation, had never taken any advantage in any sense. We came a little closer as friends. but our professional relationship was absolutely professional. No confidentiality was ever broken. Whenever he was visiting Salasar ji. I always received prasad from him and even had the opportunity to travel with him to Salasar ji. He was such a down-to-earth person who was always there to help everyone. One of my greatest regrets is that I couldn't meet him during his last moments. He is an unforgettable personality for the rest of my life.
TONY: WALKING SUNSHINE - Deepika Thapar Singh, Principal, The Air Force School (from 2007-2016)
(Page 89)
Some people leave a mark not with grand gestures. but with their grace, unwavering kindness, and the light they carry within. Tony was one such soul. I first met Tony in 2007 when I took over as the Principal of The Air Force School. From the very beginning, his presence was calming and grounded. He managed the school's printing work with efficiency, never a delay, never a complaint. always delivered with care and dignity. But it was his spirit, not just his service, that truly stood out. Tony always greeted me with a smile that felt like sunshine- warm. sincere. and full of peace. His deep devotion to the Divine was evident in every conversation. No meeting passed without his heartfelt gratitude to God, no matter the circumstances. He never came empty-handed. Whenever he visited the Salasar Balaji Temple, he brought prasad for me. These offerings were more than rituals they were reflections of his thoughtfulness and the way he always carried others in his heart. Tony had a rare gift: he brought calm wherever he went. He never rushed. never complained. and never let stress steal his serenity. Through his example, he taught me a timeless lesson- to live with ease, to stay rooted in faith. and to keep stress at bay. Every morning. his daily spiritual and motivational messages would arrive like gentle reminders to stay centered and grateful. Those messages were his way of silently uplifting everyone around him. they are now memories will always cherish. Tony, you will be missed. I miss your messages. your smile, your peaceful presence. The world feels dimmer without your light but your spirit, your faith, and your warmth live on in all of us who were blessed to know you. Rest in eternal peace, dear Tony. I know you're now in the embrace of Hanumanji, free. joyful. and at peace.
Tribute to Tony Ji - Manju Malhotra, The Air Force School
(Page 90)
I came in contact with Tony ji when I became the Exam Incharge at TAFS. What began as a purely official relationship gradually blossomed into a warm and trusted friendship. He was a deeply respectful and humble person, and anyone who interacted with him would agree that his presence left a lasting impression. Tony ji had a special way of making routine work feel more human. Often. when he came to deliver papers he would bring Dhokla for the entire exam department. Those simple yet thoughtful gestures turned into little celebrations: Dhokla paired with freshly made tea, shared laughter. and warmth. Whenever I asked. "Chai piyoge?". he would smile and say. "Yes tea bag wali to pi loonga." He also brought ladoo prasad for us many times, sharing not just sweets, but goodwill and blessings. During times of urgency, be it delays in printing or last-minute needs, he always handled everything with calmness and grace. Softly, he would say. "Ma'am. Atul will deliver the papers to your residence, can you please take them?" His humility and gentle way of dealing with situations will be missed by all of us. There was a time I urgently needed some letter pad leaves and visiting cards printed for my husband. I asked him for help. and to my surprise, he got everything printed within a few hours. and Atul delivered it to my home. Despite my repeated requests, he never accepted any money. His reply still echoes in my heart: "Bhaiya ka kaam kiya hai. aapka nahi." I remember once when I couldn't get a cab after staying back at school. This thorough gentleman didn't think twice, he dropped me home himself. Over a cup of tea. I called my daughter to come meet him. When he heard her name. Divya. his face lit up, his daughter was also named Divya. From then on. every time he came to school, he would always ask about her. Another incident that speaks volumes about his character. once we had to get a set of question papers reprinted urgently, but there was no budget for it. I was hesitant but I called him and explained the situation. His response: "Madam. aapko aaj tak mana kiya hai kya?" That amount wasn't small, but his generosity and kindness never came with a price tag. Tony ji's humility, kindness. and ever-helpful nature touched so many lives. He was more than just a professional associate, he was a friend. a well-wisher, and a rare human being. His presence will be missed, but his spirit will continue to inspire us.
In Loving Memory of Gajender Batra Ji - Atul Kumar, Friend
(Page 91)
Gajender Batra (Tony Sir) and I met in 2010 as in a part of the work course. It's really hard to put into words what I'm feeling. Batra sir was a good mentor. a guide, and someone I genuinely admired. Working with Gajender Sir was more than just a job it was a chance to learn. grow. and feel supported by someone who truly cared about the people around them. Batra ji had a way of making everyone feel seen and valued. and that's something I'll never forget. Whether it was through a kind word. a thoughtful gesture, or simply leading by example, he left a lasting impact on everyone he worked with. I'll always be grateful for the time we shared and the lessons I learned. You'll be missed. and your memory will live on in all of us who had the privilege of knowing you.
A Saint in Disguise - Gopal Dewan, Friend
(Page 91)
It's very difficult for me to write about a person who goes by many different names G. K. Batra, Tony Bhaiya, Tony Ji, and Batra Bhaiya. A man who I actually cannot describe, because he was not just a man he was basically a saint dressed as a man. He was a man with the soul of a saint. Whenever I try to write something about him, my hands fail me... my thoughts running at a fast speed. में क्या बताऊं टोनी भाई के बारे में, यारों का यार और उससे बढ़िया इंसान आपको इस कलयुग में मिलना मुश्किल ही नहीं, नामुमकिन है। टोनी भाई से मेरी पहली मुलाक़ात जायसवाल भाई के ऑफिस में हुई थी। ज़्यादा कुछ याद नहीं, केवल इतना ही याद है कि एक हंसता हुआ चेहरा और नटखटी मुस्कराहट चेहरे पर आज भी याद है। उस वक्त मैं भी हनुमान जी की आराधना शुरू करने की कोशिश में लगा हुआ था, और जायसवाल जी ने मुझे बताया कि टोनी भाई तो बहुत पहुंचे हुए भक्त हैं। शायद यही बात, यह mental compatibility, हमको नजदीक ले आई थी। हमने सालासर जाने का प्रोग्राम बनाया और 10-15 लोग 3-4 गाड़ियों में सालासर के लिए निकल पड़े। रात को धर्मशाला में आराम से सोए और सुबह जब बाहर निकला, तो भयंकर भीड़, चहल-पहल और शोर देख-सुन कर घबरा गया। मैंने धीरे से टोनी भाई को उठाया और कहा, "हम लेट हो गए हैं... बाहर तो इतनी भीड़ है!" तो वो बोले, "गोपाल भाई, आराम से सो जाओ। दर्शन हो जाएंगे, चिंता न करो।" उसके बाद तो हम कितनी बार साथ गए, कहना मुश्किल है। अब मेरा दोस्त, मेरा साथी, मेरे साथ नहीं। हनुमान भक्त, हनुमान जी की सेवा में चला गया। जय हनुमान ज्ञान गुण सागर, जय कपीश तिहू लॉक उजागर।

टोनी भैया ऐसे व्यक्ति थे जिनकी आवाज सुनकर सब खुश हो जाते थे। मुझे आज भी याद है कि मैं उनसे 1999 में मिला था 23 दिसंबर को, मैं कमला मार्केट में रहता था और काम न होने की वजह से वापिस गांव जाने की सोच रहा था, भैया ने मुझसे पैकिंग करवाई और उन्हें मेरा काम पसंद आ गया बोले "मेरे पास काम करेगा?" मैने पूछा "क्या काम करना होगा" तो टोनी भैया हंस कर कहने लगे, "तुम्हें साथ रहना पड़ेगा, जो काम कहूं वो काम करना पड़ेगा।" मैं तैयार हो गया और तब से आज तक उनके साथ हूं जब टोनी भैया के साथ पहले दिन सेना भवन (DRDO) के ऑफिस गया तो एक थी स्टार बड़े ऑफिसर आकर मुझे और टोनी भैया को अन्दर ले गए। उसके बाद वो दिन और आज का दिन टोनी भैया का साथ नहीं छूटा । मैने टोनी भैया के साथ दो साल काम किया, तब तक उन का असली नाम नहीं पता था। फिर दो साल बाद पता चला कि उन का नाम गजेंद्र कुमार बत्तरा था। पिंकी भैया के पास कुछ पेपर लेने गया था तो उन्होंने बताया था । भैया तब स्कूल में प्रिंटिंग का काम किया करते थे, फैंसी और डिज़ाइनिंग को काम भी किया करते थे। हर कोई उन के काम से खुश हो जाता था। उनके जितने भी जानने वाले लोग थे सबके जन्म दिन और सालगिरह याद रखते थे। वे किसी का कोई भी काम रुकने नहीं देते थे सब अरेंज करा देते थे। यह तो सब को मालूम है कि वो हर महीने सालासर जाते थे लेकिन, यह बहुत कम लोग जानते हैं कि वहां सभी पुजारी और धर्मशाला वाले उन्हें सुपर भक्त कहते थे। यह मुझे वहां की तन्त्रूटी धर्मशाला के केयरटेकर श्री शेखरजी ने बताई। सभी पुजारी उन्हें बहुत आशीर्वाद देते थे और वे सभी को कुछ न कुछ दान देकर ही आते थे। सभी उन्हें एक आदर्श शील स्वभाव और खुश मिज़ाज व्यक्ति के रूप में याद करते हैं। टोनी भैया के यहां इतने बड़े सफर में मुझे कभी भी यह एहसास नहीं हुआ कि मैं उनके यहां नौकरी करता हूँ। मुझे ऐसा लगता था कि मैं अपने बड़े भैया के साथ रह रहा हूँ। उन्होंने मुझे बहुत प्यार और सम्मान दिया और मुझे अपने परिवार जैसा ही मानते थे। भैया जी की आत्मा जहां कहीं भी हो श्री नारायण उन्हें अपने श्री चरणों में स्थान दे। टोनी भैया के लिए दो लाइनः "zindagi में दो लोग ज़रूर चाहिए- एक, श्री कृष्ण जो न लड़े फिर भी जीत पक्की कर दे और दूसरा कर्ण जो हार सामने हो फिर भी साथ न छोड़े" यह दोनों कला टोनी भैया में उपस्थित थी।

परमात्मा ने जन्म और मरण का समय तय किया हुआ है। बीच का कुछ समय ही मिलता है इंसान को अपने आप कुछ करने के लिए। उसमें वो दूसरों को सुख देता है या दुख देता है। जो भी कर्म हम करते हैं, वो हमारे भाग्य का निर्धारण करते हैं। बत्रा मॅडम के साथ मैंने बहुत शाखाओं में काम किया है और बहुत अच्छा अनुभव रहा है। बत्रा जी से भी वैसे तो दो-तीन बार बैंक में आते-जाते मुलाकात हुई, लेकिन उनके स्वभाव का ज्यादा अनुभव तब हुआ जब पिछले साल जनवरी में मैंने अपना जन्मदिन निरंकारी सरोवर, जो कि एक बहुत ही शांत और पवित्र खुला स्थान है, वहाँ अपने रिटायर्ड साथियों के साथ जनवरी की धूप का आनंद लेते हुए सेलिब्रेट करने का प्रोग्राम बनाया। बत्रा जी हालांकि हमारे मेहमान थे, लेकिन उन्होंने वहाँ घर के एक सदस्य की तरह खुद ही सारी जिम्मेदारी संभाल ली। उन्होंने पूरे प्रोग्राम का वीडियो बनाया, फोटो खींचे और हमें भेजे। सबके साथ ऐसे घुल- मिल के बात कर रहे थे और उनके चेहरे पर हमेशा मुस्कराहट रहती थी। उनसे मिलके, बात करके बहुत अच्छा लगता था। मेरी बिटिया भी उनसे बहुत प्रभावित हुई और उनकी बहुत ही तारीफ करती है। इतनी इंसानियत के गुणों वाले आदमी मिलना मुश्किल है। जाना तो सबको है, और वो चले गए। लेकिन अफ़सोस इस बात का है कि अचानक चले गए। क्या प्रभु ने कोई खेल रचा, पता नहीं। निराकार रूप में तो वो अब भी हमारे साथ हैं, पर उनका यूं चले जाना बड़ा अखर रहा है। मैं प्रभु से परिवार के लिए और बच्चों के लिए प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि बच्चे जीवन में आगे बढ़ते रहें, सुखी रहें, और परमात्मा का आशीर्वाद सब पर बना रहे। जय निरंकार।

ज़िन्दगी यादों का सफ़र है। यहाँ अनगिनत लोगों से मुलाक़ात होती है। कुछ याद नहीं रहते और कुछ ऐसी अमित छाप छोड़ जाते हैं जिन्हें भुलाया नहीं जा सकता। स्वर्गीय टोनी जी ऐसी ही हस्ती थे। मेरा परिचय उनसे पूनम बत्रा जी. जो मेरी बैंक सहकर्मी थी के द्वारा हुआ। कोरोना काल सन 2020 73 वर्ष की आयु में मुझे कुछ लिखने की ईश्वर प्रेरणा हुईं। कुछ कविताएँ लिखी जिसे पूनम बत्रा जी और टोनी जी ने पुस्तक रूप में प्रकाशित करने की प्रेरणा दी। घर बैठे-बैठे ही सारी सुविधाएँ उपलब्ध कराईं और मेरी तीन पुस्तकों के प्रकाशन में पूरा सहयोग दिया। टोनी जी से मिलने का अवसर कभी नहीं मिला। फ़ोन पर ही बात होती। उनकी बातों में इतना अपनापन होता लगता मैं उन्हें बरसों से जानती हूँ। उनसे न मिल पाने का मलाल हमेशा रहेगा। वह इतनी जल्दी हम से बिछड़ जाएँगे ऐसा सोचा न था। ऐसे लोगों की सूची में जिन्हें मैं अपनी स्मृतियों में हमेशा संजो के रखना चाहती हूँ उनका नाम शामिल रहेगा। ईश्वर उनकी आत्मा को शांति प्रदान करें और अपने श्री चरणों में स्थान दें । अपनी भावनाओं को व्यक्त करना ही मेरी उनके प्रति विनम्र श्रद्धांजलि है।

Gali ki Raunak
Smt. Saroj Julka. Neighbor

Ten years ago. I moved to C-C Block, Shalimar Bagh. It was here that I met the head of the Batra family. Tony Bhai. He was truly a gem of a person. affectionate, humble, and friendly. Always ready to help anyone in need. I have never met someone like him. He had a heart of gold and was a genuinely kind soul. I still remember the time I had fractured my foot and was alone at home. Tony Bhai immediately came and took me to the doctor. I can never forget that gesture. Everyone in our colony loved and respected him. He was the lifeline of our block. There used to be so much hustle bustle and Raunak and voice of Ramayana patha used to vibrate. So much activity, now it feels sad. Raunak of our lane is gone with him. His Aura was so positive cheerful and happy. The whole gali misses him and his Salasae Prasad so much. Jai Shree Ram Tony Bhai. I miss you a lot.

Humor

This page is a photo collage highlighting Tony's light-hearted and humorous nature.

Photos show him: in funny hats, pretending to be Santa, making statues wrestle at Kala Pani Jail in the Andamans, and playfully trying to make others smile.

A central quote reads: "कोई परेशान सा दिख रहा हो ना, उसे छोटी सी बात पे हसा दो, जब मुंह पर स्माइल आजाती है ना, तब परेशानी से लँड़ने की ताक़त भी आ जाती है।" (If you see someone who looks troubled, make them laugh over something small. When a smile appears on their face, they find the strength to fight their problems.)

From buying them kachoris to teaching them driving, to getting chips and chocolates for their next gen kids, his love for his nieces and nephews was beautiful and always visible.

Messages of reverence from some of those who try to emulate him every day - his nieces, nephews, some of their spouses, whom he never thought of as 'bahu and damaad', rather as more betis and betas for himself!

"AUR BETA. SAB THEEK?"
Abhishek Batra. Nephew

I have always wondered... and to this date I am not sure how Tony Chachu managed to remember everyone's birthdays, anniversaries, or anything special that happened or was happening in his near and dear ones' lives. I believe this extended beyond just the family. to his friends, extended circle. and anyone he cared for. And he would send the most amazing messages, videos, pictures to everyone... and it always felt like those were coming straight from his heart.

I think our bond was at its strongest during my college days. I was in Manipal. away from home. He would always call and check on me... "aur sab thik... kuch chaiye ho to bata dena :)" And guess what? I would call him every second month... "Chachu thode ... bhej do pls :)" And he would never miss...for anything!!

Another thing I fondly remember is the way Chachu used to respond to phone calls. He was always polite. happy... and within seconds, he would put the caller at ease... make them feel like they were the most important person for him that day :) Unintentionally. I think I have tried to take this habit from him in my personal life as well...

I guess his biggest strength was his love. for everyone and everything around him. He was always ensuring everybody was doing good... if they needed anything... he would help them out wherever, whenever Chachu wouldn't fulfil that... and you'd be like. "when did I say that I needed this :)" thank you for everything. Chachu! Love you. always!

"MY FIRST EVER BLACK LABEL BOTTLE CAME FROM..GUESS WHO?"
Akshay Batra. Nephew

The kind of relationship I shared with Tony papa has always been and will continue to be closest to my heart. There never was a "chacha-bhatija" relationship, it was always like a father-son bond that I shared and cherished. He was always there for all of us whenever we needed him. I remember since a small age. I've never seen him reach anywhere empty handed, there was always something or the other that he used to get for everyone.

Once. Papa was travelling and Tony papa had come specially from Shalimar Bagh to Mayur Vihar to take Dadaji to buy a pair of chappals because he wasn't listening to anyone and the only person whom he couldn't say no to was Tony papa. That is the kind of love and respect everyone (irrespective their age) had for him. He has always been the binding force of the family and I clearly say that whoever I know in my life, be it relatives, my friends. family friends. neighbours, extended family. even extended family's extended family know Tony Papa. That was the kind of charm and aura he had wherever he went.

My one and only trip to Salasar was everyone led by Tony Papa. Bas ek baar bolne ki der thi ki mujhe Salasar jana hai fir kya tha, the plan was made and we went. The kind of respect and love I saw in people for him- it was something else! Everyone knew him and best of best arrangements were made for us. That was a memorable trip!

And it might be hard to believe but the 1st ever Black Label bottle that I received as a gift was given by Tony Papa. I can never forget the kind of preparation stress I had before my wedding and Tony Papa said 'tu bas Dilli aaja, mein sab karwa dunga'. That was it and everything was sorted within no time. We all will always remember him with fondness. love and respect. And miss his presence around us always. But I'm sure. he always has an eye on us wherever he is.

THE UNFORGETTABLE EMBRACE: HONORING TONY MAMA
Amit Kaistha. Son-in-Law

I vividly remember my first meeting with Tony Mama. Roop and I had just decided to get married our families met for the first time in the 1st week of February 2004. at Swagath restaurant in Defence Colony Market. Immediately, a message went out across the family channels (there was no WhatsApp back then), and as soon as we wrapped up dinner. Tony Mama and his crew Ashish. Abhishek. and Tarun arrived to meet us. It was close to midnight, and his first embrace and hug (a new experience for me personally) are still something I cherish.

As the months passed. leading up to our wedding in October. I would meet Tony Mama more and more. He was the quintessential go- to person for all the wedding arrangements in the family. At that time. I didn't know him as "Jagat Mama" - it was only later, as more family events unfolded. that I came to understand and appreciate his "Jagat" name. His world was the Family, and for the family, he was the link to the world who got everything done.

The gifts, at first. caused a bit of discomfort for me (and for Roop and me as a couple), but as we got to know each other better. we found a middle ground. Over time, an unspoken bond of mutual respect and affection formed between us.

Page 101
THE UNFORGETTABLE EMBRACE: HONORING TONY MAMA (continued)
Amit Kaistha. Son-in-Law

His ability to connect with everyone - from the most senior family member to the youngest. from the rich to the poor was truly unique. He was always giving. always in service to others, whether it was his parents, siblings, the extended family, or his friends. There are countless qualities of his that stand out, qualities that are difficult for any of us to fully emulate.

I know this:

I will miss the first call and message from him on my. Roop's. my parents'. Ahaana's. and Aaradhya's birthdays and our anniversaries.

I will long for his tight embrace and hug - now that it's gone. I understand what is meant by "pyaar ki jhappi".

I will miss his thoughtful gifts (the last one he gave me was a T-shirt in September/October 2024. after his first surgery, insisting that I take it, saying. "Don't say no to this"). It's now my favorite, most treasured T-shirt.

I will no longer hear his voice during family weddings when he sang and every time I hear the word "chaubara" and the aloo bade karaare song. I will be reminded of him.

He has left an indelible mark on me. If I can be even a fraction of what he was to everyone around him. I will consider myself successful in life.

Adieu, dearest Tony Mama... you have left us far too soon, more quickly than any of us could have ever imagined. But in the time you shared with us, there are so many lessons and memories we will carry forward, emulating the kindness and love you showed to all of us.

"A FATHER FIGURE"
Anshuman Chawla. Nephew

Mamu was a father figure for me. The bond that I had with him grew over the years. and grew in different phases of my life.

In our childhood. I knew that no birthday celebration was complete without him. I remember all the fun things he made me do! One of which was betting with us to make us eat nice things! Like when there would be a few idlis left after dinner. he would challenge Tarun and me- "If you eat all the 5 idlis. I'll give you two thousand rupees"... or maybe he would say "Let's see who can finish first. all the remaining dhoklas! Jo pehle khatam karega usko 500 rupay inaam!" Same with gulab jamuns and pakoras and what not!! We connected on cricket, food and naughtiness... I used to not want to go back home. So much so that when Mummy and Papa came to get me back. I would go hide in the kitchen and Mummy would run after me..

When I made him meet Ankita. he was so happy that I am with someone who is in his neighbourhood and would always tease me to say that now you have to come to Shalimar Bagh double times.

He was my go-to person in so many ways. I will consider myself lucky if I can even be 10% of what he was to me and all my nieces and nephews.

"A HEART OF GOLD"
Anuj Saigal. Son-in-law

Tony Chachu was so many things rolled into one: a father-in-law. a friend. a guide - but above all. he was unconditional love in human form. His devotion, his humour, the zest with which he lived life, his love for food and for feeding others, his generosity... he had a heart of gold.

His words like "बेटा क्या खाएगा... कुछ मंगवाऊं" were always the first thing he would ask me every time I went to meet him. Now when I go to the house. I feel he will suddenly appear and say. "अनुज तू आ गया... आज ये खाते हैं।"

I think every moment spent with him brought out his qualities, whether it was an impromptu drop-in at the house or at a function. His never-ending zeal to do good and spread goodness and happiness and see everyone with a smile on his face. I would say is Tony-ism.

He has been like an angel sent from God to both Shweta and me, when we were trying for Aarohi and Ariana. Right from the trip to Salasar. to Amritsar, to also taking care of Shweta when she was carrying. Words are too less to describe how he has influenced us and made us what we are today.

Our relationship was always at its best. always in respect of him.

His loving. kind and thankful nature, with a strong mind to persuade anyone, was his biggest strength. He would go out of his way to make things easier for others. not worrying how it would affect him.

“चाचू – हर रिश्ते में प्यार, हर मोड़ पर साथ”
-Ekta Batra Chopra. Niece

ऐसे कई मौके हैं जब चाचू ने सिर्फ यह नहीं कहा कि "आकर ले जाओ,” बल्कि हर चीज़ खुद फेंक करवाकर courier की, और फिर खुद उसका tracking करते रहते कि पहुँचा या नहीं, कहीं कुछ खराब तो नहीं हुआ। मैं उन्हें हर बार फ़ोटो भेजती, "चाचू, सब ठीक-ठाक पहुँच गया।"

जब भी वो हमारे घर आने वाले होते, तो उनका फोन आता, "क्या लाऊं?" मैं कहती, "कुछ मत लाना चाचू, बहुत कुछ बना हुआ है।" तो कहते, "अच्छा, सफेद ढोकला ले आऊं? मटर ले आऊं? सुमित को अच्छा लगेगा? या समोसे ले आता हूँ?" मना करती रहती, तो फिर हम यही फाइनल करते कि, "चाचू, आप अपने आप ले आओ... बस quantity कम लाना!" लेकिन जब वो आते... तो बड़े-बड़े थैले भरकर प्यार लाते।

हमारा रिश्ता कुछ ऐसा बन गया था कि जो भी चाहिए, "चाचू से पूछ लो, contact तो मिल ही जाएगा!" बच्चों के birthday पर तो जैसे रिवाज़ सा बन गया था, return gift की help तो चाचू ही करेंगे। और सुमीत के साथ... सुमीत के पेरेंट्स के साथ.... चाचू ने ऐसा दिल का connection जोड़ लिया था कि उनका एक अलग ही संबंध बन गया था, जो सिर्फ मेरे ज़रिए नहीं था। वो अपनापन, वो भरोसा, वो चुपचाप बहता हुआ रिश्ता, अपने आप में बहुत ही खास था।

इशिका और चाचू का रिश्ता तो एक अलग ही स्तर पर था, एक silent connection! आँखों ही आँखों में सब कुछ कह-सुन लेना... जब भी मिलते, इशिका दौड़कर उनके पास जाती, और फिर दोनों की अपनी setting चलती रहती। आँखों-आँखों में बातें... बिना कुछ कहे सब समझ जाना, आज भी वो सीन मेरी आँखों के सामने ताज़ा है।

आप great थे, और great हैं, चाचू जी! जय श्री राम जय माता दी !

टोनी मामा - मेरा रिश्ता. मेरी यादें
Dr Manisha Sachdeva. a.k.a Tina. Niece

बचपन में टोनी मामा से मेरा रिश्ता थोड़ा धुंधला था। सब उन्हें "टोनी मामू" कहते थे. एकदम कूल वाला vibe था उनका बाकी cousins के साथ। लेकिन मैं उन्हें हमेशा "मामा जी" बोलती थी... डर से नहीं. बस एक respect था. एक दूरी भी शायद, जो समझ में तब नहीं आती थी।

2016 में जब पापा नहीं रहे, तभी से मामा से रिश्ता जैसे दोबारा से जुड़ने लगा। वो जब मुझे गले लगाते थे. वो टाइट हग. उसमें जैसे वो कहना चाहते थे. "मैं हूँ बेटा. तू अकेली नहीं है।" उस हग में बहुत कुछ था. comfort. protection. belonging.

2021 के लॉकडाउन में मैं और मम्मी कुछ दिन मामा के घर रुके थे। इतने relaxed और fun-filled दिन थे- खाना, गेम्स, बातें और वो एक गेम मुझे आज भी याद है जहाँ सबको एक-दूसरे की कोई अच्छाई बोलनी थी। सुनकर हैरानी हुई कि हमारे घर के बड़े भी इतने genuinely एक-दूसरे के बारे में बोल सकते हैं। और फिर एहसास हुआ. हम लोग अक्सर अपनों की अच्छाइयाँ for granted ले लेते हैं।

Physiotherapy Day भी मेरे लिए और मामा के लिए बहुत special होता था। हर साल September में मेरे क्लिनिक में physiotherapy day होता है. और मामा वहाँ जैसे host बन जाते थे! कभी कुछ लेकर आते. कभी गेम्स करवा देते. कभी patients से बातें करने लगते. सबको involve कर लेते थे।

Page 106
टोनी मामा, मेरा रिश्ता, मेरी यादें (continued)

He loved making people happy. कभी-कभी इतना ज़्यादा कि खुद को over-stretch कर देते थे। And I feel... कुछ traits उनके मुझमें भी हैं, और बाकी उनकी बहन (मतलब मेरी मम्मी) ke आ गए हैं।

मेरी शादी के बाद जब राजन मामा जी से मिला. तो एक अलग ही connection बन गया था। Infact. मिलने से पहले ही Mamaji ने उससे phone पर बात शुरू कर दी थी! पहले थोड़ा unknown बन के message किया, फिर धीरे-धीरे रोज़ बात करने लगे, texting every day. मुझे लगता है राजन को भी उनके साथ कुछ अलग सा connection feel होता था।

September में जब वो बीमार पड़े. तब ऐसा लगा कि उन्होंने हमें emotionally prepare कर दिया था... धीरे-धीरे। और फिर वो चले गए। शायद इसलिए आज हम सब उनके बारे में इतना कुछ लिख पा रहे हैं, बिना हर रोज़ रोए। रोते हैं... अंदर से बहुत कुछ हिल जाता है. लेकिन उनके जाने के बाद एक अजीब सी presence बनी हुई है. sadness से ज़्यादा unseen साथ महसूस होता है।

Mamaji. आपने सब कुछ दिल से किया, और हमें सिखाया कि किसी भी रिश्ते को धीरे-धीरे कैसे गहराई दी जा सकती है। आप अब भी हमारे बीच हो. उन hugs में. उन gifts में. physiotherapy day के हर कोने में... और उस energy में. जो हर किसी के चेहरे पे मुस्कान ला देती थी।

"TO LIVE SELFLESSLY AND LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY"
Mukul Arora, Son-in-Law

Tony Chachu was one of the most selfless and loving human beings I've ever known. He was always thinking about what more could we do to help others. If anyone was in any sort of difficulty, he would always, always be there. And he did all of this without any expectation from the other person whatsoever, which was really. really inspiring to see.

We've all grown up hearing phrases like: "Karm karo aur phal ki ichha mat rakho" "Neki kar dariya mein daal." They sound noble in theory but often feel impossible to live by. Tony Chachu showed us that it is very much possible. It's no surprise that he was the most popular family member.

One other quality I really admire about chachu was the way he lived in the moment, was so full of life and always had a smile on his face. When he was with kids, he would become a kid and engage with them at their level.

Tony Chachu showed us all how to live selflessly and love unconditionally. His legacy doesn't just live in our memories- it lives in the way he inspired us to be kinder. more present, and more generous. His spirit of giving, his zest for life, and his gift for bringing people together will continue to shine through in all of us. Tony Chachu will always hold a special place in my heart. and remembering him will forever remind me of the kind of human being I aspire to be.

MY VERY FOND MEMORIES OF TONY MAMAJI
Navita Sachdeva. Daughter(in-Law)

Some bonds go beyond words...deeply rooted in love. laughter. and understanding. Tony mamaji was one such presence in our life. A gentle guide. a source of wisdom. and often. the warmest comfort in the room.

I remember his infectious laugh, the way he made even the simplest moments feel special. Whether it was stories from his youth, thoughtful advice shared over tea, or just his reassuring presence during tough times, mamaji had a way of making everything better.

He taught us values without preaching, strength without harshness, and love without conditions. His legacy isn't just in the memories we carry. but in the way he shaped the goodness in our hearts.

Though he's not physically with us. I carry his smile, his kindness, and his teachings every single day.

Forever in my heart. Tony mamaji. Miss you. Jai Shree Ram.

"IT'S HONESTLY HARD TO EXPLAIN HIM IN WORDS...."
Rajan Sethi. Son-in-Law

...He was one of those persons who could make everyone feel special. like you were the only one that mattered in that moment. And he did this so effortlessly. with so much love and warmth. I saw it with myself. with my parents... he just had this gift of making a place in people's hearts.

I didn't know Mamaji for a very long time. We got to know each other after I got married in 2022. but even in that short time, there were moments that really stayed with me. He would call randomly, sometimes just to check in, or show up out of nowhere with kachoris or something he picked up on the way. He'd click many photos during family get-togethers and send them later with sweet messages. Simple gestures but so full of love.

Even when he was in the hospital. fighting for his health. low on energy and strength. he still gave me a chocolate. I still think about that. Who does that? In a moment where most people are struggling just to get through, he was still thinking about others. And every time I remember that: I think, why did I eat that chocolate? I should've kept it with me. It wasn't just a sweet, it was a moment, a memory, a gesture of pure love.

Mamaji, you are missed. Thank you for all the love, the little moments, and just being you.

STORY TIME: MUKAISH KI SAREE
Roopshree C Kaistha. Niece

It was 1995. the time of my school farewell. a truly special occasion. You all know how particular I've always been about dressing a certain way. I had a clear vision: I wanted to wear a peach-colored saree with silver mukaish work all over. That soft shimmer. that delicate elegance... it had to be just right.

I told Mumma about it, but she was unsure where to even begin. Still. we went from shop to shop. South Ex and a few other places, but nothing matched what I had in mind. Then. Mumma spoke to Mama. As soon as he heard about my saree hunt, he got excited and asked. "Kya chahiye? Kaisi chahiye?"

Mama took it upon himself like a mission. He brought back five different white sarees. each with a unique design. I still remember his taste and mine didn't always match. He kept suggesting. "Yeh wali le lo. yeh achhi lagegi." but I had already made up my mind. "No. Mamu. I want this one only." I said firmly, pointing to the one that stole my heart.

Then came the next step, dyeing it peach, exactly the shade I had dreamt of. He had it all done. I didn't have to run around anywhere, everything came to me, thanks to Mama. He did all the legwork so I could focus on my studies. He did the same process in so many other stages of our lives, when we got married. had kids - handled these little big sourcing assignments just so we would be at ease. May he rest in peace now.

MY ODE TO THE MAN WHO LOVED
Ruchika Chawla. Niece

आ चल के तुझे, मैं ले के चलूं, एक ऐसे गगन के तले, जहाँ ग़म भी न हो, आँसू भी न हो, बस प्यार ही प्यार पले। - दूर गगन की छांव में (1964)

This song epitomizes my Mamu and what he stood for me. He taught me to love unconditionally and always with a smile.

He was my first port of call. because I knew he was always there for me. and more importantly, for the family. Whether it was the white dhokla he always got for me, or the special Bharat ke seviyan ki mithai, or the dark chocolate at the hospital, he remembered all my favourites (including him and always made sure they were there.

He taught me to graciously accept love. He showered his love with gifts, hugs. and blessings. At first I used to tell him. "Rahne do Mamu." but he would not listen. So I accepted it, as all this was his way to love. He loved it when I made demands on him. and no matter what they were, all were taken care of with utmost love and care.

MY ODE TO THE MAN WHO LOVED (continued)

Rakhi is a very special festival for me. and I think somewhere, he is the reason for it. He taught us what sibling love is. and what it means to stand with them no matter what.

On Rakhis, he loved that we all got together (always preferably in Shalimar Bagh if he had his way and his sisters didn't throw a tantrum), shared laughs, love, and food. together from morning to at least the evening. if not dinner.

The last Rakhi we celebrated together, he sat me down and gave me. from his wallet, a coin he had from Vaishno Devi. I don't know since when. That coin will always hold a special space in my heart and wallet :)

Mamu Jaan, thank you for everything that you did and stood for in life. I know you are there with us, somewhere in the door gagan ki chhaon mein, looking upon all of us, blessing us, and guiding us to create a world around us, jahan pyaar hi pyaar pale! Love you, always!

"AAJ HUM KATHA SUNATE HAIN... RAM NAHI. RAM BHAKT KI..."
Saryu Khanna. a.k.a. Doctor Sahiba. Niece, his favorite Dentist

एक ऐसा राम भक्त जो सिर्फ पूजा में नहीं. हर इंसान के चेहरे पे मुस्कान लाने में विश्वास रखता था। वो थे हमारे प्यारे Tony मामा जी।

उनके जैसे लोग भगवान हर बार नहीं बनाते। वो दिल के इतने साफ. इतने उदार, इतने प्यारे थे कि लगता है भगवान ने खुद चुन के भेजा था प्रेम बांटने के लिए, इंसानियत का पाठ पढ़ाने के लिए, और दुनिया को ये याद दिलाने के लिए किः "Kindness keeps the world afloat."

मामा जी हर दिल का गीत थे. हर रिश्ते का गहरा रंग थे। उन्होंने कभी किसी का जन्मदिन नहीं भूला. हर तस्वीर को छांट छांट कर video बनाते. दो घंटे नहीं. पूरा दिल लगाते। उनके लिए हर रिश्ता एक इबादत था।

हमें उनकी यादों में रोना नहीं है. हमें उनकी बातों में जीना है. और हर दिन उनकी एक quality को अपनी ज़िंदगी में उतारना है - थोड़ा हँसना, थोड़ा बांटना. थोड़ा ममता देना। और जाते जाते. उन्हीं के अंदाज़ में - जैइइइइ राम जी की!

SEE YOU AGAIN!
Shreya Bhatia. Soumya's sister

What a personality he was - I've never met anyone so warm, so giving. He had the biggest heart. That's something to truly learn from him. He was the kind of person no one could dislike. And somehow. he was never tired. His energy was always so positive, so full of life... it was something to aspire to.

Honestly, it still doesn't feel like Tony Uncle is gone. For me, he's still around. I hesitated meeting him in his final days. I wanted to remember him the way I've always known him. I prayed a lot.

He's on his onward journey now. but we mortals will miss him a lot. They say you experience true peace when you leave this world. that's what I wish for him. And they also say that people who are close find their way back to each other in another lifetime. I believe that too.

"MAIN HOON NA"
Shweta Batra Saigal. Niece

All my life Tony Chachu has always, always been there. Good times or bad... the one constant who has always shown up for me... always providing a safe space when things got tough. And at the heart of all good times... he was there. smiling. joyful... standing with hands always overflowing with bags of food and gifts!!

His love for Bollywood and cricket was legendary!! From the time we watched the India-New Zealand semi-finals last year, where he organised the big TV and we all sat in the drawing room and watched the match (and we have done it loads of times)... to times when I was much, much younger and Chachu used to get the VCR and we used to watch हिंदी movies...

My favourite moment with Chachu was on my wedding day... he hugged me and said... "तू आराम से जा बेटा... मैं हूँ न..." These three words sum up my Chachu for me...

The time I spent with Chachu when I stayed with Chachu and Chachi while I was expecting Aarohi and Ariana... though it was a very stressful time as I had this constant fear of something going wrong... he was one person who constantly told me... "Everything will be OK... keep faith in God..."

A poem by Shweta

"Jai Shree Ram," you'd always greet,
A voice both calm and true,
Now every time I hear those words,
I feel a part of you.

A heart of gold, so pure, so vast,
You lived to give, to care,
For your parents, children, near and far-
Your matatav was rare.

SANTA CLAUS CHACHU
Sumeet Chopra. Son-in-Law

टोनी चाचू के बारे में कहना बड़ा मुश्किल है. और जब भी सोचता हूँ कि उनके बारे में कुछ कहूं, तो एकदम से बहुत सारी यादें वापिस आ जाती हैं। फिर भी कहना बहुत ज़रूरी है।

zindagi में बहुत लोग मिलते हैं जो आपको अलग-अलग तरह से इंप्रेस करते हैं. अलग-अलग मोड़ पर, जब आप बच्चे हों. जब आप पेरेंट हों। बहुत कम लोग होते हैं जो आपको zindagi में हर तरह से touch करते हैं- spiritually, mentally। चाचू मेरे लिए उस तरह के इंसान थे। उन्होंने मुझे बहुत कुछ सिखाया. बहुत कुछ दिखाया लोगों में. पर हमेशा अच्छा और केवल अच्छा देखना... क्योंकि उनकी लाइफ का एक ही मकसद था सब में अच्छा देखो। Very easy to say, but very difficult to emulate.

चाचू के साथ रिलेशन एक son-in-law का नहीं था. वो बहुत open था। हमारा relationship मेरे गुड़गांव शिफ्ट होने के बाद ही बहुत घना हुआ। हमारे passions- खाना-पीना (कचौरी, पराठे), cricket in any form- T20. One Day, or Test. or whatever... religion- सालासर धाम जाना. कार या ट्रेन से।

बच्चे भी उन्हें बहुत ही miss करते हैं. अभी भी बहुत याद करते हैं। चाचू, आपके जाने पर एक जगजीत सिंह का गाना बहुत याद आता है; चिट्ठी न कोई सन्देश, जाने वो कौन सा देश, जहां तुम चले गए।

मेरी सबसे अच्छी यादें टोनी मामा के साथ
Tarun Sachdeva. Nephew

मेरे life के आधे perfume तो Snoopy वाले मामा ही लाकर देते थे। कोई पसंद आया या नहीं, मैंने तो सब यूस किए। क्योंकि वो मामा लाए थे, बस वो ही काफी था।

जब बड़े हुए तो हमें और उन्हें दोनों को समझ आया कि कौनसा perfume अच्छा है, कौनसा नहीं। लेकिन प्यार में gesture कैसे करते हैं, वो मामा ने ही सिखाया। माबाप की respect करनी क्या होती हैं, ये भी उन्हीं से देखा और सीखा। उनके यहां में सब कुछ दिल से होता था, न दिखावा, न जबरदस्ती।

जब मेरी CA क्लियर नहीं हुई थी, तो सबको पता है मैं कहाँ गया था- टोनी मामा के पास ही। जितने भी resources उनके पास थे, उन्होंने हर एक का यूज़ किया मुझे आगे बढ़ाने के लिए।

मामा ने जो-जो सिखाया, जो-जो बातें बताई, मैं आगे बढ़ाऊँगा। बाकी किसी का मुझे नहीं पता, पर मैं ज़रूर आगे बढ़ाऊँगा उनकी बातों को। पूरी कोशिश करूँगा कि जैसे वो थे, वैसे ही कुछ बन सकूँ। बराबरी तो नहीं कर सकता - 10% भी नहीं - पर मैं अपनी तरफ से पूरी कोशिश ज़रूर करूँगा।

अभी कुछ ही महीने हुए हैं मामा जी को गए, पर आज भी कचौड़ी देखकर खाई नहीं जाती। एकदम से उनकी याद आ जाती है, मन बैठ जाता है।

Dearest Chachu.
Garima Arora. Niece

My first thought as I sit to write this is I wish I had gotten to know you better sooner in life. My childhood memories are only of meeting you occasionally at few weddings and in those occassions also feeling like - "Am I not supposed to engage with this person. but he's actually quite nice and caring and friendly with all other kids. And so. what's the problem really?"

In this memoir. I want to talk about two things that you stood for so tall. that I want to learn from and embody / keep alive in my own being and in our family's culture.

The first is "Giving". You gave and you gave wholeheartedly. And in that Giving you also "got/ received" what's most precious. Pure love and respect when you were around and even now when you're not around.

Page 120
Dearest Chachu. (continued)

The diwali visits to our home with so many gifts which held together would cover one's face! And the love and affection you showerd on Mukul and Mukul's Papa when they joined our family. Even remembering Papa's birthday on 5th of february when you were in the ICU and I visited you. and the first thing you said was - Janamdin Mubarak. Even when you were in pain yourself, your mind was thinking of others.

The other trait I want to talk about that you embodied beautifully was just being 'fun loving'. This is what helped you connect with the kids and the young ones and the 'jijus' of the family so well. at the same time as being the caring Nanu/ Son/ Mamu/ Chachu and many other roles that you played. Karaokes with you were very very fun !!! ...pyaar hua ikrar hua pe dance ...aloo bare karare sessions...all the humour and jokes ...

Most of all. in all of above, chachu you showed us what family should stand for. And if all of us can keep that culture alive in our own family and take it to all the other families that we all belong 'also' to now. and role model it to our children for their future families - that would be the best gift we could perhaps give to you for what you've taught us.

To our dearest Tony chachu - Jai Shri Ram
Richa Khattar Goyal, Niece

This is such an honor for me to pen down something for you as I know कि हमारे परिवार में आपके जैसा कोई नहीं था, कोई नहीं है, और कोई नहीं होगा। Positive, smiling, social, और सबसे बड़ी खूबी कि कभी भी आप अपना temper lose नहीं करते थे। कभी गुस्से में नहीं देखा। आप में बस खूबियाँ ही खूबियाँ थीं।

आपकी time management skills भी ऐसी थीं कि कोई beat नहीं कर सकता। दिल्ली का traffic भी नहीं, कैसे भी करके आप पहुंचते ही जाते थे। मिले बिना न जाना, न जाने देना। और कभी खाली हाथ नहीं आना।

कोई भी festival, birthday, anniversary आप कभी भूलते नहीं थे, और सबको याद भी दिलाते थे।

Myra भी आपको Tony चाचू ही कहती। आपकी दी हुई dress उसे इतनी पसंद थी, हमेशा पहन के बताती थी, "Tony चाचू gave this to me." Dress छोटी हो गई, but उस पर से एक bunny और butterfly निकाल के रखा है and still remembers that they are from the dress जो Tony चाचू ने दी थी।

चाहे आप किसी भी दुनिया में हो, हम सब बच्चे आपको बहुत प्यार करते हैं और miss करते रहेंगे because there is no one like you, and there won't be another one like you.

टोनी अंकल,
तुषार दीवान. भांजा

आप ही तो वह डोर थे जो पूरे परिवार को बाँध कर रखते थे। आपकी कमी हमेशा महसूस होगी।

आपका प्यार और मुस्कान हर पल याद आएगा। आपने हमें सिर्फ़ परिवार नहीं, एकता का मतलब भी सिखाया। आप चले गए, लेकिन आपकी यादें और संस्कार हमेशा हमारे साथ रहेंगे, टोनी अंकला

परिवार की हर खुशी में आपकी छवि नज़र आती है। आप जैसे लोग कभी भुलाए नहीं जाते।

आपका हर लफ़्ज़, हर मुस्कान, हर पल हमारे दिल में एक कहानी बनकर बसा है।

आपने कभी शब्दों से नहीं, अपने कर्मों से दिखाया कि परिवार क्या होता है। आप जैसे लोग सिर्फ़ याद नहीं, महसूस भी किए जाते हैं।

TONY-ISM a love for food...
-Divya

Papa had such a love for good food... something that brought him immense happiness always. From chole bhature with his BFFs, to dahi bhalle with his cousins, to paneer pakode with his girlfriend, to vada pav with Nikesh and me - he was a foodie to the core.

In 2001, after his stroke, that love took a different shape. He got serious about his health and stuck to it. Dinner became ghiya, tori and petha for months... maybe even years.

But his love for food never left - it just transformed. From eating to feeding. It became his love language. Even when he wasn't eating much himself, he found joy in making sure that others were enjoying the best options available.

That was his way of loving... thoughtful, inventive, and full of heart.

Page 124
... and a love for Feeding!

If he was sharing a sweet, and someone would refuse saying they don't eat meetha (sugar), he would often tell them, "yeh thodi meethe mein count hota hai!" followed by putting a chunk of boondi / laddu / barfi in their hand!

यदि वह कोई मिठाई बांट रहे होते और कोई यह कहकर मना कर देता कि वे मीठा नहीं खाते, तो वह अक्सर उनसे कहते, "ये थोड़े मीठे में काउंट होता है!" और उसके बाद उनके हाथ में बूंदी / लड्डू / बर्फी का एक टुकड़ा रख देते !

Tony's Kitchen

Bring Tony's favorite flavors to a kitchen near you.

His love for food and feeding is no suprise to anyone who knew him. What very few knew was that he was quite particular about how he liked some of his favorite items. For instance, the way the tea bag needs to mix with the water before the '2 spoons' of milk comes in. Like the baingan bharta needs to be had with the first thick slice of bread fresh from the packet. Here we try to share with you how to make some of his favorite foods, just how he loved them.

Dry Fruit Namkeen "Mixture"

Ingredients:
• Nuts: Cashews, Almonds, Pistachios, Walnuts
• Seeds: Sunflower seeds, Pumpkin seeds
• Flax seeds
• 2-3 tsp desi ghee (or to your taste)
• 2 tsp chaat masala
• A pinch of black salt
• A pinch of freshly ground black pepper
• His secret twist: a sprinkle of amchoor or anardana

Method (Just How He Did)
He'd spend 10-15 minutes dry roasting each nut on its own- cashews first, then almonds, pistachios, and walnuts- rather than tossing them all in one pan. Whenever mumma asked him, "Why spend so much time?" he'd say, "They'll steal each other's flavor if I mix them now."

Page 127
"laddu sehat wala"

Ingredients:
• 1 heaped cup soft black dates (pitted) - use Medjool or the sticky kind
• 1¼ cup almonds
• 1/4 cup cashews
• 2 tbsp walnuts
• 2 tbsp pistachios (unsalted preferred)
• 1 cup makhana, roasted
• 1 tbsp desiccated coconut (optional, lightly roasted)
• 3-4 elaichi/cardamom powder or pods - peeled and crushed
• 2 tbsp pure desi ghee (or a little more if your heart says so)

Method

Sabse pehle- Dry fruits ko ghee mein halka sa bhun lo. Not too dark, just till the smell tells you they're yummy. Set them aside.

Dates ko mixer mein daal do, make a thick, sticky paste. No water, just pulse till it comes together.
... and the recipe continues.

besan barfi

Ingredients
• 1/2 cup chana dal (bengal gram) - roast it well
• 3-4 green cardamoms - for warmth
• 1/2 cup grated fresh coconut - not too dry
• 1¼ cup soft black dates (add more if your sweet tooth says so)
• 10-12 almonds, chopped - for that little crunch

Method

First, dry roast the chana dal with the cardamom. Medium flame. Let it turn golden and smell a bit toasty - not burnt, just right.

Let it cool. Then grind it - not too fine, not too coarse. You'll know when it feels right.
... and the recipe continues.

Tony. the Elephant King (A tale from Shalimar Bagh)
Written by Atul Vasudeva (Ashish's Friend)

Once upon a time, in the urban jungle of Delhi's Shalimar Bagh, lived a gentle giant named Gajender, the Elephant King! But those who knew him well just called him Tony.

Tony wasn't like other giants. His frame was compact, but his hunger made him a giant. Not a hunger for food, but a hunger to feed people. Yes, Tony had a very special power, he loved feeding others. Not just anyone, but especially children. And he did it with love, the kind often seen in mothers and grandmothers.

Page 134
Tony, the Elephant King (continued)

When I first met Tony, I was a little scared. All the kids were. He had such a big appetite, to love, to feed, to give. But slowly, he drew me in. He'd call me to his den, and I'd try to say no. "But I just had food..." "I have food at home..." Tony didn't care. He believed something special: "Stomachs are made of infinite elastic!"

One day, Tony disappeared. No goodbies. No farewell feast. Just... gone.

They say he passed on to another dimension. I like to believe he's out there, in some magical world, still feeding children, still smiling, still offering 1+1 on all things delicious. His reign of tasty terror lives on... just in another realm.

Tony Nana is the best Mana ever. He's really really kind. and he's. like, always prepared. Like. he always has stuff to give us as his granddaughters and grandsons.

He is also really fun. He jokes around really nicely. and he was always nice to me. and to Ahaana. no matter what. All the time.

He really cared about everyone! Just the emptiness in my heart will never go away.

PEOPLE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT HE WAS VERY VERY KIND AND HE ALWAYS HELPED OTHERS NO MATTER WHAT!!
-ESHIKA CHOPRA. GRANDDAUGHTER

Chachu Nanu was always showing us unconditional love. He was always buying us gifts. getting us food. always getting us what we wanted... even when we did something bad like breaking something.

His strength and weakness were actually the same!! His strength was helping people... but his weakness was also helping people. (when asked to explain.) "It was nice of him to help. But sometimes if you help people a bit too much. then they can get greedy."

A WORLD MADE BETTER BY TONY CHACHU
-Suhaani Chopra. Granddaughter. 15

What stood out the most to me about Tony Chachu was his unconditional love, his love for food. and even more, his love for feeding others. which was truly special. But beyond that. it was his generosity of heart that stayed with everyone who met him.

Feeding people wasn't just something he did. it was who he was. He always made sure everyone else had eaten before thinking of himself. Every time he came to our house. I knew I'd have good food to eat for the rest of the week, because he used to bring so much. And I knew it was always going to be good food.

Page 140
A WORLD MADE BETTER BY TONY CHACHU (continued)

He had such a warm personality and treated everybody the same way, with such love, that everybody remembered him more than anyone else they had met. One of the clearest visuals I have of him is of him walking into our home with his arms full of bags and packets. his hands full and his heart fuller. That's how I will always remember him.

His greatest strength was the relationships he created, just by being the person that he was. Anything and everything you needed. Tony Chachu had a contact for. Because he just knew so many people. And people, willingly, without any reason or expectation. wanted to do things for him. Because he was just that person.

What I will always carry with me is this: every time I catch myself being egoistic or mean towards someone... I feel like I should take a step back and try to view the world the way Tony Chachu did where there is good in everybody.

It's just... the world was a better place with him in it, that's how I felt. And I feel like... by the end of my life. if I can be even ten percent of who he was, then I'll know that I've made a difference. Because he did. To so many people. To me.

EPILOGUE
Proudly, Divya Batra Masiwal, Tony's Daughter

Now to you, the readers, the contributors, and everyone flipping through these pages - Thank you. By reading this, by carrying a bit of him with you, you're keeping my father close... and that means more than words can express.

And look at this book now. 150 pages filled with stories from people who loved him. Who saw him. Who respected him. I hope this book helps them and you process his absence. While I always felt like I was at the center of his world, reading these memories has shown me how many others he made space for... how deeply he connected with so many.

So to everyone who shared a part of him with us - thank you. You've given me more of him than I thought I'd ever get back.

If there's one thing I hope you leave with, it's something he taught us just by being who he was... love freely, give generously, and don't wait to show up for the people who matter. This is how we keep Tony-ism alive, by acting it out, one quality at a time!
